<h1 title="">The Boy Scouts of the Signal Corps</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">GREAT EXPECTATIONS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! you, Billy Worth!&rdquo; cried the leader of
the Wolf patrol, a tall youth of seventeen
named Hugh Hardin, addressing his assistant.
&ldquo;Scramble out of that bunky, my boy, in two
wags of a Wolf&rsquo;s tail, or I&rsquo;ll have scout&rsquo;s law
on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, chief! Coming!&rdquo; was the prompt
response, as Billy, thus adjured, turned over
in his bunk and thrust one long leg over the
edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>His bare brown foot, dangling perilously
near the head of another boy whose bunk was
beneath Billy&rsquo;s, proved too great a temptation
for the lad. Pulling a whisp of straw from
his mattress, he proceeded to tickle the sole
of that foot, thereby causing Billy to elevate
it hastily with a loud squeal.</p>
<p>As he did so, Hugh made a dexterous sweep
of his arms, and, grasping Billy around the
knees, almost flung him over one broad shoulder
and deposited him none too gently on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; whooped Billy.</p>
<p>His shout and the dull thump of his fall
aroused other inmates of the cabin who had
not already wakened in time to witness the
onslaught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Murder!&rdquo; yelled a scout of the patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; another boy said, laughing, as
he sprang from his bunk. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on
here, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt, are you, old man?&rdquo; inquired
Hugh, a trifle anxiously, for he seldom cared
to perpetrate practical jokes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No response from Billy. He lay where he
had fallen, with one arm outstretched, the
other pillowing his head. His face was covered
by a limp hand, but between his fingers
he slyly peeped out, and his twinkling eyes
sought the serious face of Hugh, who was
bending over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s done for!&rdquo; said the lad who had
tickled him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put him to bed, chief, for
he will be happier there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring this facetious suggestion, Hugh
bent still lower; he even dropped upon one
knee, and put his hands on Billy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, son!&rdquo; he urged, smiling and giving
his chum a gentle shake. &ldquo;First round is
over, and in ten seconds you will be counted
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>This was the chance for which Billy had
been waiting. Now he saw that Hugh was
completely off his guard. Suddenly his free
hand shot out, grasped Hugh&rsquo;s ankle from behind,
gave it a strong push&mdash;and the next instant
Hugh measured his length on the floor.
Before Hugh could fully realize what had happened
to upset his equilibrium, Billy gathered
up his own sprawling limbs, and hurled himself
upon his fallen leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down and out, am I?&rdquo; he gurgled. &ldquo;Who
said so? Come on, we&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; As he spoke, Hugh
struggled free from the other&rsquo;s hold, and met
the reprisal with his usual jolly laugh. &ldquo;Good
for you, Billy! Good one on me! O-ho!&rdquo;&mdash;he
dodged nimbly a &ldquo;half-Nelson&rdquo; which Billy
had vainly attempted&mdash;&ldquo;none of your famous
strangle-holds, now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Then ensued a rough-and-tumble match, the
outcome of which was awaited in joyous suspense
by every scout in the cabin. They all
gathered in a wide circle around the wrestlers,
showering liberal encouragement. Had the
match been between Hugh or Billy and a member
of the other patrol, however friendly, it
might not have been greeted with the same impartiality.</p>
<p>The circle soon narrowed, for not more than
three minutes elapsed before both contestants
were down on their sides, facing each other.
Hugh, being quicker and less stockily built
than his chum, was the first to make a final
overthrow. In a trice, he pulled Billy under
him; and, though Billy put up a good fight, he
crumpled flat under Hugh&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Get off my arm,&mdash;it
hurts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, son,&rdquo; said Hugh, when murmurs of
applause had died away. &ldquo;Shall I put you back
to bed now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Laughter greeted Hugh&rsquo;s query, for Billy
Worth bore an undeserved reputation of being
a sluggard. On his part, he took the laugh
good-humoredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you call doing a daily good
turn?&rdquo; he inquired of Hardin, with a grin.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve begun the day nicely, I must say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> did the good turn, old scout!&rdquo; called
Walter Osborne, of the Hawk patrol, from
across the room. &ldquo;I never saw a neater tumble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a fall out of you for that, Walt!&rdquo;
threatened Billy, cheerfully. &ldquo;If we have archery
practice to-day, you&rsquo;ll miss a feather
from your wing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; came a chorus of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly at him, Walt!&rdquo; urged one of young Osborne&rsquo;s
patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, beak and claws,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy the Wolf&rsquo;ll catch you if you don&rsquo;t
watch out!&rdquo; chanted a third, in a sing-song
voice, thumping his pillow as if to beat time
to the words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Neither Billy nor Hugh made any response
to this friendly taunt. Hugh turned aside and,
going to the rear of the room where a tier of
lockers stood, numbered to correspond with
the bunks, he drew out a pair of bathing
trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going for a swim before breakfast?&rdquo; asked
Billy, turning to a young fellow who appeared
in the doorway of the cabin and paused on the
threshold outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; came the evasive answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet! The Lieutenant gave us permission
yesterday, and we&rsquo;re off to the lake, bright
and early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; remarked the outsider, glancing
around the cabin, which was filled with boys
in various stages of undress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Something in the tone of his voice, a note
of wistful bitterness, struck the ears of Hugh
Hardin, who was standing near enough to
overhear this brief colloquy. He looked up
from the process of tying the strings of his
shorts tight, and was on the point of making
some remark, when, recognizing the visitor,
he kept silence.</p>
<p>Billy Worth was not so tactful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Alec,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;The water&rsquo;s
fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on police duty, as punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punishment? For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carelessness,&rdquo; was Alec&rsquo;s truthful, albeit
sulky, reply. &ldquo;Yesterday I dumped &lsquo;Buck&rsquo;
Winter out of a canoe,&mdash;though it wasn&rsquo;t all
my fault. The kid wouldn&rsquo;t keep still, and
he told me he could swim like a fish,&mdash;and he
was nearly drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! That little piker! Why, he <i>can</i>
swim! Didn&rsquo;t he capture two points from us
last week, in the hundred yards?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong again, Billy! It was his brother,
who is the star swimmer of our patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your Otters put it all over us, Alec,
in those water games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why we are so glad to have morning
practice,&rdquo; added Hugh, in a tone which he
honestly intended to be kind. &ldquo;We Wolves
want time to find out what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck must have lost his head,&rdquo; remarked
Walter Osborne, who had drawn near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Alec, emphatically, &ldquo;and he
gave Chief Hardin a chance to qualify in first-aid&mdash;at
my expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the resentment that
underlay those words. Walt and Billy glanced
uneasily at Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>A flush stained Hugh&rsquo;s bronzed cheeks and
brow at the retort, and he turned away scornfully,
biting his under lip. It was hard to keep
his temper in control, as a scout should; but
he managed to do so, and the next moment he
was outside the cabin, filling his lungs with
deep draughts of the pine-scented air and
watching the mists roll up the side of the opposite
mountain. With the coming of the sun,
he was able to take fresh note of his surroundings,
and his eager dark eyes dwelt fondly
upon the familiar scene in the first light of a
new day.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a scene to stir any red-blooded
boy. As far as Hugh could see through the
lifting vapor lay the lake, a great silvery mirror
reflecting the heavily wooded shores so
clearly that the inverted forest appeared no
less real than the original. From the shores
of the lake, in every direction, hills sloped ruggedly
up into mountains, for the most part
clothed to their summits with the variegated
green of a mighty woodland. The side of one
of the nearer mountains was scarred by exposed
ledges of bare rock, which, as Lieutenant
Denmead, the Scout Master, had said, would
make fine strategic points for the Signalers&rsquo;
Game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it some day this week,&rdquo; he had
told Hugh on the previous evening, as he sat
with his assistant scout master, Rawson, and
the leaders of the four patrols around the
camp-fire.</p>
<p>Hugh recalled that vague promise now, as
his gaze wandered from those rocky ledges to
the deeper hollows not yet penetrated by the
sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p>How dim and mysterious they looked! How
Hugh longed to explore them and to discover,
by means of such woodcraft as he had already
learned, the treasures hidden in those shadowy
nooks and ravines!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Several boys of his patrol followed him from
the cabin. They saw that something had vexed
him, but they made no comments, even among
themselves. Presently they dashed away,
down to the shore of the lake, where most of
the boys from the other cabins were gathered.
These boys belonged to the Otter and the Fox
patrols.</p>
<p>Left alone for the moment, Hugh waited
for Billy and Walter, to whom he had decided
to make an explanation of Alec&rsquo;s thrust. As
they walked down to the lake together,&mdash;Alec
having departed on his rounds to the chip-basket,&mdash;he
told them how he had happened
to be on hand to give assistance at the canoe
accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t help very much, really,&rdquo; he finished,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see why Alec should be so
sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind him, Hugh; he&rsquo;ll get over
his grouch after a while,&rdquo; declared Billy. &ldquo;He
is jealous of you because you qualified as a
first-class scout before he did, and because
you are in line for a merit badge as chief scout
woodsman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, son!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter, turning to
greet an eager-faced boy, Number 8 of his patrol,
who had trotted up behind them. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
eating you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do-do you know why the Big Chief has
called a m-m-meeting of the patrols this morning?&rdquo;
panted the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Walter. &ldquo;But we
will find out after breakfast. Run along now,
son, and mind: not more than ten minutes in
the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; promised the
younger boy, and he raced ahead several yards.
Suddenly he stopped short, turned around, and
waited for the trio to come up. &ldquo;I-I say,
Hugh, will you&mdash;will you do me a favor?&rdquo; he
inquired hesitatingly. &ldquo;Will you coach me on
the crawl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know! That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
here for,&rdquo; Hugh responded heartily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>A few more strides brought them to the
shore of the lake, where they stood for a moment,
watching a group of boys swimming out
to the raft. Then, with a quick &ldquo;Come on,
now! Watch me!&rdquo; Hugh leaped forward into
the water, followed by Walter and Billy. The
boy whom he was coaching stood knee-deep
in the water, gazing with admiration not unmixed
with envy at the powerful yet easy overhand
strokes that sent the swimmer through
the ripples without apparent exertion, yet at
a speed that made his own best efforts seem
hopeless. In another moment he, too, was
breasting the lake, and soon he gained the raft
and climbed upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s brief
comment, at which his admirer glowed with
pleasure. Praise from Hugh, who was usually
so reserved, was rare indeed!</p>
<p>Just as they were practicing swift dives, a
bugle call rang clear and full across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;recall&rsquo;,&rdquo; gasped Billy. &ldquo;Wonder
what&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means everybody report at once,&rdquo;
said Don Miller, leader of the Fox patrol.
&ldquo;Back to shore, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit her up, son!&rdquo; added Walter, and, suiting
his action to his words, he slid rapidly
through the clear water, leaving a wake of
swirling ripples.</p>
<p>As soon as the swimmers reached shore,
they hurried to their respective cabins, dressed,
attended to their beds, and then repaired to
the larger log-house, where a bountiful breakfast
was served. During the meal the talk
was all of the eagerly anticipated meeting of
the patrols, and everyone wondered why it
had been called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Mess over, Don Miller and Walter Osborne
took their stand at either side of the cabin
door, and as each boy passed out he saluted
the two chiefs with the scout&rsquo;s salute, and was
saluted in return. This was a point of etiquette
upon which Lieutenant Denmead, who
was a retired officer of the United States Army,
always insisted, believing that it did much to
maintain discipline and to instill the scout virtues
of courtesy and of respect for superior
officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">FORMING THE SIGNAL CORPS.</span></h2>
<p>A cheer, heartier and more informal than
military, rose from forty throats, as Lieutenant
Denmead and Assistant Scout Master
Rawson came forth from their quarters to
break the news to the assembled boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts of Pioneer Camp,&rdquo; began the lieutenant,
smiling, when silence had been restored,
&ldquo;I have called this meeting in order
to lay before you a plan which I think will
merit your approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of you have heard that in two weeks
there are to be National Guard maneuvers
over in Oakvale and the adjoining meadows,
not far from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of assent greeted this question,
and the Scout Master continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Part of these maneuvers will be the work
of a carefully trained and efficient signal corps,
and you boys will undoubtedly be interested
in seeing that, among the other events. To
understand it thoroughly, you should have
some practical knowledge of the system of
signaling; that is, the semaphore signal code,
the wig-wag or Myer code, and the sound
codes. You should know how to send and receive
messages by each and all of these three
methods. Such knowledge may be of great use
and benefit to you or to others, at any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your woodcraft games, in trailing and
stalking, in hunting, you have learned the various
signals used in Indian warfare, the signs
and blazes along a forest trail. Some of you
are familiar with the Morse telegraph alphabet,
and every tenderfoot who does not know
it must learn it, in order to qualify as a second
class scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what I propose to do is this: Let us
form a signal corps made up of scouts from
our four patrols, who can show by superior
skill that they can qualify. Proficiency in any
branch of scout-craft, in any of our games or
pursuits (but particularly in the art of signaling)
counts in determining who shall join
the corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of points or &lsquo;honors&rsquo; won by
each scout makes his record. From each patrol
two boys who have made the best records
will be chosen, and the leader of the corps
will be the scout who has scored the greatest
number of points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Denmead paused, and his clear
gray eyes roved searchingly over the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I made all this clear?&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, while the
boys exchanged eager glances among themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;How does the plan appeal to you?&rdquo; asked
Lieutenant Denmead.</p>
<p>Another cheer greeted this question, showing
the degree of interest felt by the majority.
Many of the boys were enthusiastic; a few,
whose interests lay in less serious sport, such
as water games, canoeing, fishing, photography,
field-day events, etc., rejoiced in it chiefly
because their prowess in such activities would
be counted toward election for the corps; two
or three remained silent, considering it from
their individual standpoints.</p>
<p>Among these reflective ones was Alec
Sands. Sitting on the ground beside Don
Miller, he had listened attentively to the Scout
Master&rsquo;s proposition, and he had seen in it
only an opportunity for additional rivalry between
the two cabins,&mdash;which meant between
Hugh Hardin and himself. For, by tacit consent,
Hugh and Alec were regarded as the two
principal leaders among the scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>To Alec,&mdash;who had gained his leadership of
the Otter patrol by unquestioned ability in
scout-craft rather than by virtue of the true
scout spirit of kindness and equality,&mdash;rivalry
meant a certain degree of hostility to &ldquo;the
other fellow.&rdquo; Being the spoiled son and heir
of a railroad magnate, Alec was inclined to
consider himself a little above his companions.
To compete with them was an act of condescension.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hugh Hardin, though
but slightly less favored by fortune, was by no
means a snob. His patrol was made up largely
of boys who had not come from homes of
wealth, yet among them there was not one who
would ever have suspected, from Hugh&rsquo;s bearing,
that he had been born with the proverbial
silver spoon in his mouth. Reserved and self-reliant
as he was, he possessed an apparently
inexhaustible fund of good-humor, energy,
and ready sympathy with others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The Scout Master&rsquo;s plan struck a responsive
chord in Hugh, to whom Alec&rsquo;s personal
view of it would hardly have occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great idea! Don&rsquo;t you think so, Billy?&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All to the good, chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walt knows a lot about ordinary telegraphy,
you know. That ought to come in handy
and count several points for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bud&rsquo; Morgan, in our patrol, worked with
a surveying crew last summer. He learned
most of the sig&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it! The big chief has something more
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Lieutenant Denmead
continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since most of you are scouts of the second
class, and have some knowledge of elementary
signaling, we can start our try-outs for the
corps by playing the Signalers&rsquo; Game this
morning. I would like to see what you can
do in work with the semaphore codes. It is
going to be a perfect day, clear and sunny, and
we ought to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game is one for good signalers; nevertheless,
those of you who are not so expert
can take part in it and learn the first principles.
How many of you know how to play
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>About eleven hands were raised confidently,
then two others went up almost timidly, as if
the owners were uncertain of their knowledge.
The Scout Master counted them, then turned
smilingly to his assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rawson, there will be quite enough for the
first try-out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will take charge
of the smallest division, you of the largest. In
that way we shall work to the best advantage.
I observe that most of those who seem confident
of their ability as signalers are Otters.
I shall need a few of them, and you may distribute
the others as you think best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this is how the
game is played: The troop must be split up,
temporarily, into three divisions. Division A,
numbering eight scouts, will go with me to
some position on high-ground,&mdash;like those bare
ridges on old Stormberg yonder,&mdash;where we
can command a good view of the stretch of
country between here and the mountain. We
will take with us our semaphore flags, to-day,
although any other signaling apparatus will
serve equally well in the game. Division B,
numbering twelve scouts, will then go out and
keep under cover in this stretch of country
which we, the signalers, or defenders, overlook.
This division, keeping under cover, will
try to dodge or trick the signalers by appearing
in different places and disappearing, and will
finally take up a concealed position. After Division
B has been out fifteen minutes, the rest,
Division C, under command of Mr. Rawson,
will leave camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then Division A will signal down to Division
C, or attackers, the position of the hostile
Division B, and other details that will help the
attackers to advance unseen and surprise the
enemy. Of course, Division B, the enemy, is
watching the signals all the while. To win, the
attackers must capture the scouts of Division
B by surrounding their hiding-places. If Division
C passes by more scouts than they capture,
it counts a win for Division B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a time limit of, say, two hours
upon the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following this explanation, came a series of
questions about minor details of the game,
which were answered by Rawson, while Lieutenant
Denmead undertook the arrangement
of the troop into three divisions, so that in each
division there should be a certain number of
scouts who were familiar with the code.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>It so happened that Alec Sands, Don Miller,
Walter Osborne, and a lad named Arthur
Cameron, who belonged to Hugh&rsquo;s patrol and
was just finishing his first month&rsquo;s service as
a tenderfoot, together with Bud Morgan and
three others, were chosen to form Division A,
much to their delight. Hugh was assigned to
Division B, the so-called invaders or enemies,
while Billy Worth became Assistant Scout
Master Rawson&rsquo;s right-hand man in charge
of Division C.</p>
<p>Taking their semaphore flags, the first division,
led by the Scout Master, sallied forth
from camp. They followed a faintly defined
trail which ran close to the shore of the lake
and thence up the nearer slopes of old Stormberg,
climbed up and up, scrambling over rocky
patches of ground, plunging through thickets
of white birch, ash, and maple, until they
reached an elevation whereon grew only a few
somber spruces and pines, but which commanded
a magnificent view of the surrounding
territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>As these eight signalers proceeded on their
way, they eagerly discussed ways and means
by which their other activities could be correlated
with working for the signal corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any exceptional feat of woodcraft scores
twenty points in the record of the scout who
performs it,&rdquo; announced Lieutenant Denmead.
&ldquo;For instance, the scout who positively identifies
the largest number of birds, animals, or
trees may count twenty points to his credit; he
who obtains the best six photographs of living
wild animals may count fifteen points each;
the same for him who makes the best collection
of botanical specimens, insects, or minerals.
And the prime requirement for the corps
will be to send or receive a message by semaphore,
American Morse, or Myer alphabet, sixteen
letters per minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don gave a low whistle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think that is pretty stiff?&rdquo; inquired
Denmead, turning to him with an encouraging
smile. &ldquo;Just you wait! I expect you fellows
will be even more expert than that before
these two weeks are over. Look out there, Arthur!
That ledge you are standing on is rather
slippery, my boy. Now then, Osborne, you
and Sands go forward along that bare rib of
rock, out to its edge, where you see a blasted
pine-tree. Brace yourselves against the trunk
and the lower branches, if they&rsquo;re not rotten,
and keep a look-out over the backwoods trail
from camp. I suspect Division B will take
that trail first. Have they left camp yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell, sir,&rdquo; called back Walter, when
he and Alec had crawled to the end of the
ledge. &ldquo;I think they must have left, though,
because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have, they have!&rdquo; interrupted
Don, pointing down to a clump of willows that
grew in marshy ground near the easternmost
arm of the lake. &ldquo;See those blackbirds flying
out in circles down there? That shows they
are scared by something passing through the
willow grove.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The next moment, while they were taking
their places and preparing to use the flags according
to the alphabet-diagrams they had
studied, there came to their ears, faint and far
away, the low, weird, mournful howl of a wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Hugh Hardin calling his own patrol,&rdquo;
declared Billy. &ldquo;Sounds like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trick!&rdquo; muttered Alec, under his breath.
&ldquo;He wants to make us look for him in some
place where he is least likely to appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to the wolf call came the
subdued yet shrill &ldquo;<i>Kree-kree-eee</i>&rdquo; of a bird
of prey, and, by an odd coincidence, a hawk
was seen soaring rapidly above the tree-tops
in another direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of your Hawks are over there,
Walt,&rdquo; observed Alec. &ldquo;The real bird is making
no noise that I can hear. There he goes
now! Watch him swoop down into that open
glade! Wonder what he saw? A rabbit, most
likely. Well, it must be nearly time for Division
B to go into hiding, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention, boys!&rdquo; Lieutenant Denmead&rsquo;s
voice sounded close beside them, and he blew
one long blast on his whistle, meaning &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;On guard! Look out for my next
signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Get your flags
ready. Watch for signs of the enemy. What
is that over in that patch of scrub-oak yonder?
Hello! Three of them! And running for
cover, like mad! Signal it! Signal it, Alec!
There! Now Division C has started from
camp. They&rsquo;re advancing to the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">A PERILOUS ENCOUNTER.</span></h2>
<p>The three scouts of Division &ldquo;B&rdquo; who had
been sighted by the Lieutenant as they made
a dash for cover were Cooper Fennimore,
Buck Winter, and his brother Sam, who, mistaking
a sound signal of three blasts of Hugh&rsquo;s
whistle, had been creeping forward quite
openly across a clearing made by lumbermen
during the previous summer, thereby coming
in full view of the signalers perched on the
ribs of old Stormberg.</p>
<p>Alec and Walter, acting under Lieutenant
Denmead&rsquo;s rapid-fire commands, lost no time
in signaling this information to the advance
guard of Division &ldquo;C,&rdquo; as soon as the latter
made their sortie from camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Instantly Rawson led his attackers in the direction
of the clearing, instead of taking the
backwoods trail, as Hugh and his followers
had done.</p>
<p>From a coign of vantage on one of the upper
forks of a young oak tree, which he had
climbed with the agility of a monkey, Hugh
perceived the trio&rsquo;s mistake. He had intended
to warn them by those three shrill blasts, but
they had evidently counted only two, which
would have meant &ldquo;Safe&mdash;Go ahead.&rdquo; Now,
to leave no room for doubt, he sounded a succession
of long, slow blasts meaning &ldquo;Scatter.
Get further away,&rdquo; and accompanied them
with the Wolf&rsquo;s peculiar, long-drawn-out,
&ldquo;<i>How-oo-ooo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether these sounds could reach the ears
of the signalers he could not tell, but he had
the satisfaction of seeing Cooper and Sam dart
across the clearing and plunge into the surrounding
underbrush, where they could easily
find some place to hide in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Of course, any one of the attacking party
could not fail to hear the whistle signals; but
that did not matter, as it would be difficult,
at best, to locate the scouts exactly, since all
of Division &ldquo;B&rdquo; were doubtless in hiding by
this time.</p>
<p>Not all, however; for there on the edge of
the clearing, in full view of the sending station,
stood Buck Winter gazing wildly around
him, evidently trying to make up his mind
where to hide. As usual, Buck had lost his
head.</p>
<p>Craning his neck, Hugh could see in the distance
two flags,&mdash;one held by Bud Morgan,
and the other by Arthur Cameron,&mdash;pointing
directly, it seemed, at the bewildered Buck.
Another flag, on the end of the mountain ledge,
was being jumped rapidly up and down, to
urge speed on the part of the attackers. The
air was so still and clear that morning that
the defenders&rsquo; flags could be plainly seen:
small, waving patches of brighter color against
the blue of the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Hugh read their messages rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if they can see me?&rdquo; he asked himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better climb down, get Buck out of
danger of being captured, and sprint over to
those rocks. Then I can&mdash;oh jingo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uttered the exclamation aloud, for at
that very moment he caught sight of Billy
emerging from the timber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck! I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; yelled Billy, dashing
forward to seize the young Otter, who
promptly turned and fled.</p>
<p>Hugh watched the chase with keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy is no match for that kid, in speed,&rdquo; he
commented. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never capture Buck! Wish
he could! If one of Division B <i>must</i> be captured
so soon, I want it done by a Wolf, anyway:
that would give our patrol two points.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Suddenly Billy Worth stumbled against a
half-buried root, staggered, and fell headlong,
rolling over and over on the dry leaves. Buck
Winter raced ahead&mdash;straight into the arms of
two scouts of Division &ldquo;C,&rdquo; who had skirted
the clearing and come out most unexpectedly
on the further side.</p>
<p>The first capture was made. The attackers
had won the first victory.</p>
<p>In silent dejection Buck took his way back
to camp, while his captors signaled the news
to the eager watchers on the mountain, and
then ran on to join their comrades who were
hunting in the woods.</p>
<p>As Buck passed Hugh&rsquo;s tree, Hugh called
down to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Buckie! You&rsquo;ll do better next
time! You would have got away from Billy
easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cinch!&rdquo; retorted Buck, in an effort
to revive his drooping spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;m coming down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Hugh!&rdquo; warned the
lad. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Rawson coming this way, and
he&rsquo;ll see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he walked away, and soon was
lost in the shadows of the trail.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hugh descended cautiously,
crawled on all fours through the tangled underbrush
and ferns, and then, rising, strode
swiftly yet noiselessly toward a group of
lichen-covered rocks, behind which he
crouched and waited.</p>
<p>All around him he could hear the rustling
of leaves, the snapping of dry sticks, the low
calls of unseen comrades who were trying to
discover and surround the hiding-places of his
division. At intervals there would be dead silence
in the forest; and once, peering over a
jagged boulder, he caught sight of Billy making
questioning signals to the defenders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Two others of his division passed him, returning
to camp, having been found and
&ldquo;touched&rdquo; by the attackers. It was evident
that Division &ldquo;B,&rdquo; the enemy, was getting the
worst of the game! Perhaps they had not had
time to hide. Before starting out, he had told
them to select the most unlikely places for concealment.
Perhaps they were hidden where
they could not watch and read the signals. Not
much sense in that, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Suddenly a low snarl, like that of an angry
feline, startled Hugh. Glancing around him,
he beheld a lean, gray, spotted creature
crouched upon a rock not more than ten feet
away from the spot where he stood. The creature&rsquo;s
large pointed ears were laid back, its
short tail was jerking viciously from side to
side, its amber-colored eyes were glowing with
a greenish light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobcat!&rdquo; muttered Hugh aloud; adding inwardly:
&ldquo;and she&rsquo;s mad at me, too!&rdquo; He
raised his voice to a bolder pitch. &ldquo;Scat! Sca-a-at,
you spotted devil!&rdquo; he almost yelled, advancing
a pace nearer the animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>But the bobcat did not move.</p>
<p>Hugh &ldquo;froze&rdquo; in his tracks. Indeed, a chill
shiver crept along his spine; his nerves seemed
to tingle as with cold. Without being actually
alarmed as yet, he realized that he had
nothing except his knife with which to defend
himself, in case the beast should spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; Hugh decided;
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t scare her. She won&rsquo;t budge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the bobcat&rsquo;s only movement now was
to crouch lower upon the rock, tearing its
mossy covering with her claws, flexing the
muscles of her sinewy flanks. Would she risk
a leap at her enemy? Never had Hugh encountered
a wildcat so fearless, so determined
to stand her ground. Yet this one was not
cornered, not at bay; she had every opportunity
to bolt and vanish in the thicket. Why,
why did she remain there, poised in that
menacing attitude upon the rock?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Like a flash, the only probable explanation
came to Hugh: &ldquo;Kittens!&rdquo; he reasoned swiftly.
&ldquo;There must be kittens hidden somewhere
near. I&rsquo;d better&mdash;no, if I turn she <i>may</i> spring;
you never can tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By mere chance his foot dislodged a small
stone from the earth. Stooping quickly, still
keeping his eyes on the bobcat, he picked up
the stone and flung it at the snarling beast.
It struck sparks from the rock, glanced off, and
went bounding into the dense undergrowth,
whence came a very human howl of anguish.
The bobcat vanished&mdash;but only for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you doin&rsquo;; throwin&rsquo; stones?&rdquo;
wailed a voice, and Sam Winter stood up above
the ferns, rubbing his shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
fair, Hugh!&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;You are betraying
me to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t throwing stones at you, you
chump! I didn&rsquo;t know you were there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you trying to hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bobcat, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bobcat? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;oh, look! There she is, just
slipping around that stump! Look out, Sam!
Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a yell, Sam turned and fled, leaving
Hugh again face to face with the creature.</p>
<p>Reckless defiance of danger, a foolhardy
lust for battle, now seized Hugh; and all else
was forgotten: his comrades, the game they
were playing, the record he hoped to make.
Here was a far more exciting game, matching
his quickness, his steadiness of nerve, with
the fierce instincts of that denizen of the forest.
Unarmed, he might lay her low with a
stone or his hunting knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Grasping another stone somewhat heavier
than the first, in his right hand, he took careful
aim. The next moment, the stone whizzed
through the air, there was a blood-curdling
screech, and a furry body hurtled across the
intervening space, straight toward him. In
mid-air, however, it seemed to waver; then it
fell headlong to the ground, with a thump,
kicking up a shower of dry leaves and clods.
By a miracle, Hugh&rsquo;s well-directed missile had
struck the cat on the ribs, breaking them; and
she had not had time to check her leap, which
had inflicted internal injuries.</p>
<p>Hugh was trembling now with the reaction
of excitement. He could scarcely believe that
he had taken such a slim chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I was, what a fool!&rdquo; he
gasped, looking down on the dying wildcat.
&ldquo;I ought to have had more sense than to take
such a risk. I&rsquo;m sorry I killed her! I&rsquo;m sorry
and ashamed. Poor thing! I must put her out
of misery; it is all I can do now. Oh, I won&rsquo;t
forget this for many a day! What a blind-lucky
fool I was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you were,&rdquo; said a deep voice beside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that you, Mr. Rawson? Have you
your automatic there? Please, please finish
the poor brute! I-I&rsquo;ve wounded her&mdash;after
provoking an attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you, saw the whole episode,&rdquo; Rawson
declared grimly.</p>
<p>He drew his revolver, a shot rang out
through the wood, and the bobcat lay still.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Hugh swallowed hard, choking down a lump
in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to report this&mdash;this
exploit,&rdquo; said Rawson gravely, laying a hand
on Hugh&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll want
the skin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The absence of any word of praise, any congratulation
on his narrow escape, made Hugh
feel doubly ashamed. To be sure, he had done
a very plucky thing, he had shown a certain
sort of courage which, had it been exerted
wholly in self-defense, would have won golden
opinions from his comrades, instead of this
tacit censure on the part of Rawson. But
there was nothing to do except brazen it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es, I want the skin,&rdquo; he replied slowly.
&ldquo;It will remind me of&mdash;of&mdash;not to do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it and welcome, old man. When you
have skinned the critter, you will go back to
camp. I&rsquo;ve caught you, see? You&rsquo;re my
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young leader of the Wolf patrol, self-accused
of needless slaughter, glanced at his
superior with a look of unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I forgot! Are we still
playing that game?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A FIRE IN CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>The game was over by the time that Hugh,
after a fruitless search for the bobcat&rsquo;s kittens,
returned to camp, and Division &ldquo;C,&rdquo; the
attackers, had won the day.</p>
<p>Owing to the fact that each division had
been made up of scouts from the four patrols,
no single patrol could claim the honor of victory,
although individuals in each patrol who
had done good work in signaling were complimented
by their fellow scouts, as they all
were gathered around the camp-fire that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alec Sands will surely make the corps,&rdquo; declared
young Osborne. &ldquo;The Chief said that
he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; interrupted Billy, whose
loyalty to Hugh made him loath to hear Alec&rsquo;s
praises sung. &ldquo;You have a good chance, too,
Walt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel sure at all, myself,&rdquo; Walter replied,
yawning. &ldquo;Say, Billy, what&rsquo;s the matter
with Hugh this evening? Look at him sitting
over there, talking to the Lieutenant!
He&rsquo;s as solemn as a great horned owl. Do
you know what he did all afternoon, after we
got back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to see the Lieutenant first, and
showed him the pelt of a big bobcat he&rsquo;d killed.
Gee! it&rsquo;s a stunner, Walt! Then he spent two
hours out on the field, practicing wig-wags
with Bud Morgan. You see, to-morrow we
are going to change divisions, so everyone will
get a fair trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully! We all need a lot of practice. Even
Alec is a little rusty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the same way with the Myer code and
the American Morse,&rdquo; continued Billy. &ldquo;Each
one, in turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the next two weeks?&rdquo; queried a boy
who sat beside them.</p>
<p>Billy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit too long,&rdquo; Walter affirmed.
&ldquo;We want to make a good showing as a corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope it will be a nice day to-morrow,&rdquo; said
the boy, looking up at the sky with its glittering
host of stars. &ldquo;I want to take some
photos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll be able to, all right,&rdquo; was
Billy&rsquo;s confident rejoinder. Billy was a born
optimist, ever ready to see the doughnut before
he beheld the hole; he had the happy
faculty of expecting and looking for the best
always, in conditions as well as in people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel the grass,&rdquo; he suggested a moment
later, passing his hand lightly over the sward.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as dry as chips. You know what that
means?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous to light fires,&rdquo; said the other
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, for a tenderfoot!&rdquo; quoth Billy,
with a grin. &ldquo;But I was thinking of a little
rhyme which I&rsquo;ll repeat for your benefit, if
sufficiently urged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;When nights are cold and days are warm,</p>
<p class="t0">A circle round the moon means storm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the information!&rdquo; laughed the
tenderfoot. &ldquo;You can see the moon&rsquo;s rim
clearly now. Plenty of sunshine to-morrow?
I doubt it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;When the grass is dry at night,</p>
<p class="t0">Look for rain before the light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we can&rsquo;t do anything but wait
and see,&rdquo; commented Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>With which sage remark he rose, stretched
himself sleepily, and crossed over to where the
Scout Master and Hugh were seated upon a
fallen log.</p>
<p>As he approached Hugh, who was gazing
into the fire with his hands clasped over his
knees, Billy noticed a group of boys of the Otter
patrol gathered around Alec Sands, and
heard Alec say to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have stalking games to-morrow
afternoon, after signal practice in the
morning. Don&rsquo;t let those Wolves give us all
the go-by in stalking, fellows! If we do, it
will give every one of them a chance to score
a lot of points. I hope it will rain; then we&rsquo;ll
have to do something else, or perhaps everyone
can do just what he likes best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>There were murmurs of approval, indistinguishable
to Billy, who passed on and took a
place by Hugh&rsquo;s side. Presently the whole
troop was listening attentively to Lieutenant
Denmead&rsquo;s clear and concise explanation of
wireless telegraphy. It was his custom to give
informal talks on various subjects during these
meetings at the evening council-fire, and to
outline a program for the ensuing day.</p>
<p>When the council was adjourned, at a quarter
of nine, the scouts retired to their cabins.
Alec and two other boys, being still on police
duty, extinguished the fire, scattered and trod
upon the few remaining embers, and then
sought their bunks. Half an hour later, the
profound silence of the forest was broken only
by the eerie hoot of an owl and the nocturnal
chorus of frogs in a distant marsh.</p>
<p>Soon after midnight, Hugh, whose bunk
was near the open window of the cabin, was
awakened by a faint smell of smoke. A light
breeze had sprung up during the night, wafting
that pungent, unmistakable odor to his sensitive
nostrils. Instantly he sat up and threw
aside his blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;wake up,
son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no response save his assistant&rsquo;s
deep, quiet, peaceful breathing.</p>
<p>Knowing that Billy had a chronic objection
to being awakened suddenly, if at all, Hugh
was thoughtful enough to respect his friend&rsquo;s
amiable weakness even at this crisis. Leaning
over the sleeper, he took Billy&rsquo;s hand, held it
a moment, then pressed it firmly. The result
was that Billy stirred comfortably and opened
his eyes, without a start or a protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he drawled
sleepily, blinking at Hugh through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell smoke,&rdquo; was the whispered reply.
&ldquo;Billy, do you think a fire has broken out in
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Fire?&rdquo; Billy sniffed the air. &ldquo;Say,
Hugh, it can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;S-sh! Not so loud! We don&rsquo;t want to
wake up the whole cabin. Come outside. If
anything&rsquo;s happened, we must act at once, or
at least give warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where it is coming from? Hope
it isn&rsquo;t a fire in the woods! That would be
more than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he remembered his
conversation with the tenderfoot about the
dryness of the grass, and coupled it with a
warning which the Scout Master had given
them that very day, concerning the danger of
starting forest fires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is criminal to leave a burning fire,&rdquo; Denmead
had said. &ldquo;Always put out a fire with
water or earth. A fire is never out until the
last spark is extinguished. Often a log or snag
will smoulder unnoticed after the flames have
apparently been trodden down, only to break
out afresh with a rising wind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Had this happened now? Billy wondered,
as he followed Hugh to the door. Had the
scouts on police duty been guilty of criminal
carelessness?</p>
<p>Outside, the two lads instantly discovered
the cause of their alarm.</p>
<p>Some of the sparks from the camp-fire must
have lodged between the logs of the mess-cabin,
and, lying undisturbed and unnoticed
there, have slowly eaten their way through the
resinous wood until it was ignited. Little
tongues of flame were licking one wall, but as
the soft breeze was blowing <i>away</i> from Cabin
2 and the Lieutenant&rsquo;s cabin, no one could have
detected the smoke, unless by mere accident.
Even Joe, the half-breed guide who, with the
cook, occupied a tent not far removed from
the mess-cabin, was apparently oblivious of
the threatened danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Yet even while Hugh and Billy, each snatching
a bucket of water that stood outside their
cabin (left there for morning ablutions) ran
over to the scene of peril, they caught sight
of a shadowy form in the moonlight, rushing
from Cabin 2, and heard a voice hoarse with
anxiety call out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering, they dashed the two
pailfuls of water upon the flames, and were
gratified to hear an immediate sizzling that
told them the fire had not bitten deep into the
log walls; indeed, it had only grazed the bark
and outer rings of wood.</p>
<p>The third fire-fighter had now come up to
them, but he hung back a little, as if nervously
anxious to avoid recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, Billy! Get another pailful!&rdquo; directed
Hugh, in a low voice, and his comrade sprang
away to carry out instructions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll club it
out with this roll of old canvas. It&rsquo;ll be out
in a&mdash;oh, is that you, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! Hugh!&mdash;Billy! Please don&rsquo;t
make any noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you afraid of, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of&mdash;of&mdash;oh, nothing; only I think we can
put this little fire out, and&mdash;and perhaps no
one will be any the wiser, except ourselves.
Here, let me help you!&rdquo; He seized the small
roll of canvas with hands that actually trembled,
and began to assist Hugh in beating out
the flames. &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, if this is my fault,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? You won&rsquo;t say anything
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; whispered Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be seen by daylight to-morrow.
The charred logs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can smooth them off with my knife.
Here! Slam it against this one! That&rsquo;s the
way. Again! Softly, no noise! Thank goodness,
here comes Billy with the pails!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Alec ran forward to meet Billy and to relieve
him of his burden, leaving Hugh to wonder
why he had spoken so strangely. Why
this shrinking on Alec&rsquo;s part? Had he been
in any way responsible for the mishap? In
spite of his proficiency in woodcraft, Alec was
sometimes thoughtless, impulsive, not thorough
in his methods. Carelessness was his
besetting sin. But lack of courage to own up
to a mistake? Surely he was no coward! If
he had done wrong, he would admit it, make a
clean breast of it, and &ldquo;face the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These thoughts passed swiftly through
Hugh&rsquo;s mind while he stood watching Billy
and Alec pour a stream of water from the
pails upon the fire.</p>
<p>In a few moments the flames were extinguished,
but Hugh&rsquo;s curiosity in regard to
Alec&rsquo;s desire for secrecy was not quenched.
He resolved, however, to say nothing more on
the subject; it was no concern of his, anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out!&rdquo; announced Billy cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you think there&rsquo;s been much
damage?&rdquo; Alec questioned, still speaking in a
low and guarded tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say. Wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is very slight,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will show, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to show. I might be blamed
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Billy, astonished. &ldquo;Why, how
could you be blamed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; Alec replied soberly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way: When Dick Bellamy and I put
out the council-fire this evening, after the
Lieutenant had left us, we were so darned
tired we didn&rsquo;t take any extra great pains in
doing it. All we did was to sprinkle a little
water over the embers, throw dirt on them,
and tread them down. Oh, yes, I,&mdash;I mean
Dick,&mdash;did pile a few stones around them, but
that was all. I heard Rawson say he thought
it was going to rain to-night. Now if anyone
can prove that this little blaze started from
sparks from the camp-fire,&mdash;which will be
pretty hard to prove, after all,&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be the
dickens to pay, and I&rsquo;ll lose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He cut his
explanation short with a glance in the direction
of the guide&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear footsteps?&rdquo; he asked nervously.</p>
<p>Mechanically, the three listened. There was,
indeed, a muffled tread upon rustling leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s asleep, anyway,&rdquo; remarked Billy,
as a stertorious rumbling greeted their ears.
&ldquo;Perhaps Joe&rsquo;s sneaking out on the war-path!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His good-natured levity jarred upon Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Billy!&rdquo; he exclaimed irritably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get my knife and scrape away
this charred wood. Will you fellows help me
fix it nicely? Just for appearance&rsquo;s sake, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind it. How fussy you are, Alec!&rdquo;
remarked the unsuspecting Billy. &ldquo;Let it go.
I&rsquo;m too sleepy. Come along, Hugh. Me for
my little bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>When the two Wolves went back to their
lair, Alec followed them, on a pretense of having
abandoned his idea of subterfuge. He saw
that Hugh disapproved of it, and he resented
that attitude.</p>
<p>Bidding them good-night, he hurried to his
locker, got out his favorite claspknife, and returned
to the mess-cabin, upon which he at
once began to work, whittling off the burnt and
half-burnt wood.</p>
<p>In the midst of this occupation, he heard
the same stealthy footsteps, and, looking up,
saw Joe, the half breed, standing beside him.</p>
<p>The grin that distorted Joe&rsquo;s features made
his splendid white teeth fairly gleam in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me know wot you do dere,&rdquo; he said softly.
&ldquo;Me hear wot you say to Hugh Hardeen. Why
you say eet, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec gave an uncomfortable start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell on me, Joe?&rdquo; he asked, with
a laugh of pure bravado. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty
good friend of mine, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joe your frien&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, Joe, and I&rsquo;ll tell my father to
be sure and hire you for a guide up in Maine,
next October. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him to give you
more pay than the other guides get, too, if&mdash;if
you&rsquo;ll say nothing about this accident.
Someone else can take the blame, for a
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some boy he get bad talk. Not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Alec laughed again, a
strained, hollow, mirthless laugh. &ldquo;Joe, I
know you admire my silver-handled knife;
want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no want it, Joe take it. Tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t like Hugh Hardin, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The halfbreed&rsquo;s answer was merely an ambiguous
grunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, just now,&rdquo; said quick-tempered
Alec Sands.</p>
<p>Joe said nothing. Doubtless he understood
the hint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">REVEILLE.</span></h2>
<p>When Alec stole back to his cabin, noiselessly
entered it, and climbed into his bunk,
half an hour later, it was not very clear in his
mind how he could contrive, even with Joe&rsquo;s
possible assistance, to bring Hugh Hardin into
the shadow of blame for the fire. Of course,
he could admit that he had caught Hugh and
Billy in the act of putting out the flames, and
the fact that they had done it secretly, as it
were, without arousing the whole camp, would
cast some suspicion upon them.</p>
<p>But their words would be worth exactly as
much as his, and, moreover, Hugh would have
Billy&rsquo;s testimony in support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>How much credence would be given to the
halfbreed&rsquo;s vague hints? Could Joe be trusted
to say anything? Or, might he not even say
just the wrong thing at the critical point, the
right thing at the wrong moment?</p>
<p>These questions troubled Alec as he crept
shivering between his chilly sheets and drew
his blanket around him closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I had primed Joe a little more,&rdquo; he
said to himself miserably, &ldquo;but perhaps I&rsquo;ll
get a chance to speak with him again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this comforting reflection he sank into
uneasy slumber.</p>
<p>It was strange that a boy trained in the principles
and spirit of scout-craft, particularly a
boy who had reached Alec&rsquo;s position among his
mates, could be capable of feeling such
jealousy as Alec showed in his attitude toward
Hugh. But young Sands was an unusual boy,
and he had always been over-indulged. Only
with difficulty had he ever been able to overcome
an instinctive dislike of any rival, and
in the case of Hugh he had not tried to do
more than comply with the rules of outward
courtesy that obtained in camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The rules of Pioneer Camp were few and
simple, and every boy in the four patrols that
formed the troop was put on his honor and
trusted to live up to them. Faithfulness to
duty, one of the scout virtues, was required
by Lieutenant Denmead, and scarcely a boy
in the camp cared or dared to shirk.</p>
<p>Reveille was sounded at six o&rsquo;clock every
morning, except Sunday, when it was an hour
later. At six-thirty on week-days and seven-thirty
on Sundays mess was served to two of
the patrols, and half an hour later to the other
two, the patrols alternating in the order of
service. Noon mess was served from twelve
to one o&rsquo;clock, and evening mess from six to
seven-thirty. At nine o&rsquo;clock came &ldquo;taps&rdquo;
which meant &ldquo;camp-fires carefully extinguished,
lights out, and every boy in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Every morning, also, a detail from each
cabin was assigned to police the camp; that is,
clear up all rubbish, chop fire-wood, draw
water from the bubbling spring nearby, wash
dishes, and keep the camp in order.</p>
<p>In the two log cabins, the beds were plain
box bunks arranged in a double tier down the
sides, each containing a tick stuffed with
straw. Red blankets, sheets, and a thin pillow
filled with aromatic fir balsam completed
the equipment. Of course each boy was expected
to look after the airing and making of
his own bed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the bugle sounded before
sunrise next morning, all was hustle and activity
at the camp, in strange contrast with the
quiet lake and the majestic calm of the mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Hardly had the notes of the bugle call died
away in impressive silence, when new echoes
were aroused to sudden life by the lusty shouts
and calls of forty boys, who, being thus musically
wakened from the profound sleep of
healthy and vigorous youth, sprang from their
bunks and bestirred themselves about their
morning duties.</p>
<p>It seemed to Alec, however, that he had slept
scarcely an hour. He felt tired and out-of-sorts
with himself and everybody else, quite
devoid of any zest for the events which the
day might bring forth. Wearily he rose, partly
dressed, and went outside the cabin, where,
upon a bench, stood a row of aluminum washbasins,
each with a towel, soap, and brush and
comb to bear it company. While he and Dick
Bellamy performed their ablutions, envying
those who were going down to the lake for a
swim, Alec &ldquo;pumped&rdquo; his comrade with leading
questions, in an effort to find out whether
Dick knew anything about the fire. To his
satisfaction, Dick appeared wholly unaware
that any accident to the mess-cabin had occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Dick was jubilant that morning, because it
was the last morning of his week of police
duty. After this day he would be free to follow
his own devices and in various ways build
up his record for election to the signal corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day, Alec,&rdquo; he remarked genially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for ducks!&rdquo; retorted Alec, glancing
up at the sun which now shone ominously red
through a veil of low, swiftly-moving clouds.
&ldquo;Looks like rain,&rdquo; he added, in explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For fish, too,&rdquo; said Bellamy. &ldquo;You know
they always bite better a morning like this.
I hope to get some big ones to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of fish,&rdquo; began Alec, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
going to have some broiled trout for breakfast
this morning, some that you and Don
caught yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broiled&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, Alec, what time is it
now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter past six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will those lucky chaps never come up from
the lake? I&rsquo;m almost starved! Where, oh,
where has my tummie gone?&rdquo; warbled Dick,
as he resumed his dressing leisurely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
&rsquo;most starved and I can&rsquo;t pull my belt in another
hole. &rsquo;Cause why? There isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Dickie, patience. Take courage,
don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Bellamy breathed a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worry!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worry that
is troubling me, it&rsquo;s want of food. I&rsquo;m ravenous!
My insides are in such a state of emptiness
that they resound like a drum. I could
eat every scrap of a five-pound sirloin steak
this very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam Winter, overhearing
the remark as he passed by, dripping
water from his limbs and hair. &ldquo;No, you
couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;not with me around!
I&rsquo;d defy you to get your lunch-hooks on it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Dick cocked an eye in Alec&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it, fellows,&rdquo; he urged maliciously.
&ldquo;Think of a nice juicy steak an inch thick,
cooked to a turn, and all covered with delicious
crisp fried onions! Doesn&rsquo;t that make your
mouths water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swimmer moaned and clapped both
hands over his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak of it! I
can&rsquo;t stand it! It makes me feel faint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he went on into the cabin, followed
shortly by his brother.</p>
<p>After Buck came a whirlwind of glistening
white forms racing up the path from the lake
to the cabin door, piling through it, and scattering
in all directions to dry and dress themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where Spike and Shorty are going
this morning?&rdquo; said a lad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll show up before lunch,&rdquo; replied
one of the Fox patrol carelessly. &ldquo;I heard
them say they were going up-stream in a canoe,
with Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec pricked up his ears. So he would not
have a chance to speak privately with Joe that
morning! The halfbreed would be away from
camp, perhaps taking Spike to some sylvan
glade in the forest among the hills, where he
could take photographs of living wild animals,
and where &ldquo;Shorty&rdquo; McNeil could collect specimens
of rare plants. Why had he, Alec, not
asked permission to enlist Joe&rsquo;s instructive
services on some expedition yesterday, while
waiting with the scouts on the summit of old
Stormberg?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently we&rsquo;re not going to have signal
practice to-day?&rdquo; he said wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&mdash;if it doesn&rsquo;t rain. If it does,
I&rsquo;ll vote for water-polo, instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll second that motion,&rdquo; returned Alec.
&ldquo;Hurry up, now! It&rsquo;s nearly mess-time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Half an hour later, when the boys were
seated at the long table in the dining cabin,
they heard the sudden patter of raindrops on
the roof of the building, at first soft and
stealthy, then louder and faster, as the drifting
clouds relinquished their burden. There would
be no games that morning, it was feared; yet
there was a hope that the heavy shower would
be over within a couple of hours. Meanwhile,
there was always plenty to do, and the small
but well-selected library in Lieutenant Denmead&rsquo;s
cabin was available at all times.
Thither some went immediately after breakfast,
while others, donning bathing-suits, disported
themselves in the lake or on it in canoes.</p>
<p>Among the latter, those whose energies were
not even dampened by the rain, were Hugh
Hardin and Don Miller, and they forthwith
rounded up a few followers from their respective
patrols and proposed a game of canoe-tag,
at which Rawson consented to be umpire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Hearing of the plan, Walter Osborne and
Alec Sands summoned their patrols, each with
the appropriate patrol-call, and inquired who
would take part in the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make it a game between the two
cabins, with any number of canoes,&rdquo; said Walter.
&ldquo;The game is for one canoe to tag another
by throwing a cotton bag filled with
corks <i>into</i> it. It&rsquo;s great sport, and it gives
you a chance to show what you can do with
a paddle; you&rsquo;ve got to be so quick about dodging,
turning, and chasing around! The rules
are just like those of ordinary cross-tag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of playing tag, merely, why don&rsquo;t
you get up a tilting-match?&rdquo; suggested the
Scout Master, standing in the doorway of his
cabin and listening with interest. &ldquo;Play it
with the two larger canoes each manned by
four of you, four of a patrol from each cabin
in one canoe tilting with four of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; exclaimed Alec.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will be even more fun,&rdquo; Walter
agreed warmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run ahead down to the
lake, and put the plan up to Hugh and Don.
Come on, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sped down the path, followed by several
of his Hawks who were eager to take part in
the tilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to draw lots to see who shall
man the canoe,&rdquo; he said, as he ran on. &ldquo;There
are more of us than can play at one time, but
we will all have a chance. Where&rsquo;s Alec?
Why isn&rsquo;t he coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stayed behind to collect his ablest Otters,&rdquo;
said Arthur Cameron, in reply, &ldquo;and I
saw him talking with the Chief, just before
we ran ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I guess he&rsquo;ll be with us in a few
minutes. Hugh! Don! Come here! I&rsquo;ve got
something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>In a few words, he repeated the lieutenant&rsquo;s
suggestion, which the others welcomed readily.
Alec soon joined them, having satisfied
himself that no one as yet had noticed the carefully
concealed damage to the mess-cabin, and
presently the four young patrol leaders were
drawing lots, while their followers were dragging
the two &ldquo;war canoes&rdquo; out of the boat
house, making them ready to launch.</p>
<p>For each canoe four men were required: a
spearman, who was also the captain, a pilot,
and two oarsmen. It fell to Hugh&rsquo;s lot to be
spearman of the first canoe, of which Bud
Morgan was one oarsman, Cooper Fennimore
the other, and Arthur Cameron the pilot. In
the other canoe, manned by the Otters, Alec
was pilot, Dick Bellamy spearman, Sam Winter
and a tenderfoot being oarsmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Armed each with a light ash pole eight feet
long with a soft pad on one end, the spearmen
took their places on a little quarter-deck or
raised seat in the bow of the canoe. On the
other end of each spear was a hook made of
a forked branch about a foot long, one limb
being lashed to the pole, the other projecting
out and slightly backward. Both ends of the
pole were wrapped in waterproof, to keep it
from getting wet and heavy. The padded end
of the pole was intended for pushing the enemy
from his stand upon the deck of the canoe,
while the hook could be slipped behind his
neck, if a quick change from pushing to pulling
should be required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To push your opponent back into the canoe
on one foot counts you five; both feet, ten,&rdquo;
said Denmead. &ldquo;If he loses his spear, except
when he may be pushed overboard, you count
five. If you put him down on one knee on
the fighting deck, you count five; two knees,
ten. If you put him overboard, it counts twenty-five.
One hundred points is a round, a battle,
we&rsquo;ll say, is two rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cheer broke out, as the two canoes dipped
lightly into the water and skimmed over its
placid surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>By this time, as luck would have it, the rain
had ceased, and the lake shone like polished
steel under a gray sky. The figures in the
canoes were silhouetted sharply against it, as
the light craft darted to and fro over the
waters. Sam was a better paddler than Bud,
but Bud&rsquo;s slight clumsiness with the paddle
was offset by Hugh&rsquo;s superior deftness as a
spearman; indeed, at the first encounter of the
canoes, Hugh almost succeeded in pushing
Dick Bellamy down on his knees, and was prevented
from doing so only by Alec&rsquo;s quick
turns and returns.</p>
<p>Alec would fain have had Dick&rsquo;s place and
felt the grim satisfaction of contending with
Hugh; but that was not to be, this time. Failing
that, he did his level best to &ldquo;put it all over
poor old Bud,&rdquo; as he expressed it to himself;
and once he tried the trick of pretending to
run his canoe accidentally against the Wolves&rsquo;
when Dick had succeeded in hooking Hugh,
thus making Hugh lose his balance and drop
back into his canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But Rawson, the keen-eyed umpire, declared
this move a &ldquo;foul,&rdquo; and so the Otters did not
win those ten points.</p>
<p>The battle lasted almost half an hour, at
the end of which time the Otters won, owing
to Alec&rsquo;s skill as a steersman and Sam&rsquo;s strong,
even stroke which he so skillfully adapted to
the tenderfoot&rsquo;s. The next battle, between the
Hawks and the Foxes, was not so long; it
ended with Don&rsquo;s laughable plunge into the
bosom of the lake, a victory for the Hawks.</p>
<p>Amid cheers and shouts of encouragement,
the canoe warriors returned to their cabins;
and that afternoon the signaling games and
practice were resumed. And thus, with alternate
recreation and instruction, the days
passed swiftly, bringing in their round the one
eventful day when the members of the signal
corps were to be chosen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE CHOSEN FEW.</span></h2>
<p>Up to that day the records were fairly equal,
the honors well distributed. The Otters had
scored heavily by Alec&rsquo;s winning the trail-finding
contest and the stalking event, and
Sam the long-distance swim. The relay-race
had been won by two Foxes; the high and
broad jumps, the pole-vault, and the fifty-yard
dash by the Hawks; while Billy Worth, for the
Wolves, had captured the rope-climb, and he
and Hugh together had distinguished themselves
in the two-mile cross-country hike without
compass or trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Even more important than these athletic
events were the various ways in which the
winners as well as the losers had made good
individual records. For example, one lad had
completed a really remarkable set of flashlight
photographs taken in the heart of the woods
at night; another had &ldquo;rigged up&rdquo; a wireless
instrument and built an aerial; a third had
carried out some signal-tests with a heliograph;
and Arthur Cameron had established a
camp weather bureau, running up a set of flag
signals each day in communication with the
nearest United States Weather Bureau, which,
upon request, sent daily bulletins to Pioneer
Camp. Arthur, in charge of this weather bureau,
found it full of personal interest as well
as an opportunity to render the camp a real
service. He made a weather vane of an old
arrow which Joe gave him, posted a daily bulletin,
kept a record of temperature, and measured
the rainfall and the velocity of wind. For
this achievement he received so many points
that his election to the corps, like that of
Walter and Hugh, was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Again and again, in the various signal practice
games, Walter, Alec, and Hugh had
proved their ability to send and receive messages,
in all codes, at the prescribed rate of
sixteen letters per minute; so they were sure
of making the corps.</p>
<p>At last, after much deliberation, the Scout
Master and his assistant decided upon the following
scouts for the corps:</p>
<p>From the Wolf patrol, Hugh Hardin and
Arthur Cameron (no longer a tenderfoot).</p>
<p>From the Hawk patrol, Walter Osborne
and a lad named Blake Merton, who, toward
the end of the trials, showed unexpected skill
as a signaler.</p>
<p>From the Otter patrol, Alec Sands and Sam
Winter.</p>
<p>From the Fox patrol, Cooper Fennimore
and his chum &ldquo;Spike&rdquo; Welling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Strangely enough, neither Don Miller nor
Billy Worth qualified for the corps; the former,
because his chief energies had gradually
been drawn into another channel of interest;
the latter, because he was absorbed in
the study of forestry. Billy hoped to obtain
a merit badge for forestry, so his disappointment
was but slight in comparison with his
zeal.</p>
<p>On this account, however, and because he
wanted to become thoroughly familiar with
the surrounding country, he was given permission
to accompany the members of the corps,
guided by Joe, on a ten-mile cross-country hike,
which was planned as a final test to see who
the leader should be. Of course, the Scout
Master joined the hikers. A day and a night
were allowed for the expedition.</p>
<p>So on the same day the corps was formed
it set forth from camp, bound for Oakvale,
where the National Guard maneuvers were
soon to take place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be two divisions of the Guard,&rdquo;
explained Denmead, &ldquo;the Red Army and the
Blue Army. Within a day or two I expect a
visit in camp from my old friend Major
Brookfield, of the National Guard, who will
give us further details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many miles are we supposed to cover
to-day?&rdquo; inquired Blake Merton, as the corps
were descending the further slopes of Stormberg,
and threading their way through a ravine
or gulch that presented only a broken
path between jagged rocks and moss-grown
boulders, along the dried bed of a stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three miles in one group,&rdquo; was the
Scout Master&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;When we come out at
the end of this ravine, we&rsquo;ll separate; Joe will
lead some of you northward as far as Rainbow
Lake, and the rest will follow me in an easterly
direction until we meet at the lower end of
the valley, near the town of Oakvale. That
will be about the middle of to-morrow morning.
Then, by pretty steady &lsquo;hiking,&rsquo; we
ought to be in camp again by to-morrow night,
as we&rsquo;ll return by a shorter route.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Emerging presently from the shadows of
the narrow gulch, the corps halted to rest and
to draw lots for a division of their number.
Half an hour later they were again on their
way, separately; and, at twilight, Joe&rsquo;s party
came in sight of a small lake set like an emerald
in the darker green of the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rainbow Lake, hurrah!&rdquo; cried Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurro!&rdquo; shouted Billy, the odd number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure it is,&rdquo; Alec advised scornfully;
then, turning to the guide: &ldquo;Is that
Rainbow Lake, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, him Rainbow,&rdquo; grunted the halfbreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there could be no doubt,&rdquo; said
Hugh, politely. &ldquo;The route which brought us
to this spot was clearly marked on my map,
and it opened up as we proceeded. For the
last hour or more, in spite of Alec&rsquo;s opinion,
I&rsquo;ve felt sure we were following the right
course. Joe knows this country, trust him for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet he does!&rdquo; put in Billy.</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s compliment was not without effect
on the guide, who was already growing weary
of Alec&rsquo;s continued rudeness to the Wolf
leader.</p>
<p>They were some three or four hundred feet
above the lake, and behind them lay the notch
amid the mountains through which they had
come. Although the descent to the lake was
steep in places, they would have very little
trouble in getting down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great up here,&rdquo; remarked Spike Welling.
&ldquo;I say, Hugh, what&rsquo;s that little white
mist blowing away from us down there above
those trees? It looks like an Indian smoke
signal, but if someone were lost in the woods
there&rsquo;d be two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, what do you make of that?&rdquo; asked
Hugh.</p>
<p>The guide was leaning against a projecting
point of rock, gazing down at the lake without
the least sign of emotion. Suddenly he
straightened himself and sniffed the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunters down there, make fire, cook bacon,&rdquo;
he announced solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you can smell frying bacon,
at this distance?&rdquo; queried Blake. &ldquo;Joe,
that nose of yours is sure a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe grunted and grinned. &ldquo;Hungry,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Nose good; better when hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s have some grub, ourselves,&rdquo;
suggested Billy. &ldquo;Then we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Wait till we get down little way.
Then make camp for night; then eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>As they could plainly see, the shores of the
lake were deeply indented by many inlets and
coves. Even from this height, it was impossible
to survey the entire surface of the lake.
Afar to the eastward there seemed to be a
portion of it hidden amid some hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! it certainly is pretty!&rdquo; said Billy, noting
the great variety of trees, shrubs, and
plants that clothed the hills with verdure.
&ldquo;Where do you intend to pitch camp, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you say, Alec?&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that little plateau we&rsquo;re coming to,&rdquo;
said Alec confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you say, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I marked a spot on my map where I
thought would be a good place for a one-night
camp,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right here where we
can be in signal communication with Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s weather bureau, and thence with camp,&mdash;in
case anything happens,&rdquo; he added, with a
glance at Joe.</p>
<p>For a few minutes they trudged on in silence.
Then:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; grunted the halfbreed, as they
reached the spot Hugh had pointed out. &ldquo;We
camp here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greater part of the next two hours was
consumed in gathering branches suitable for
a lean-to shelter, building a fire-place of flat
stones and cooking the evening meal. Finally,
when the lean-to was constructed, and a goodly
fire was blazing cheerfully in front of it, they
chatted and laughed as they ate supper.</p>
<p>After supper, Blake Merton, who had a very
agreeable voice, entertained them by singing a
number of Irish melodies. The others, with
the exception of Joe,&mdash;who strolled to and fro,
sniffing the breeze,&mdash;joined in the choruses.
But soon Hugh lapsed into silence, listening
to the plaintive airs, feeling a strange, indescribable
thrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s worrying Joe?&rdquo; he remarked,
during a pause in the singing.</p>
<p>Alec looked up quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he didn&rsquo;t like the way those
hunters left that fire over there,&rdquo; said he, then
added in a louder tone: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be too
careful of fires, you know, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this observation was intended to reach
the ears of Blake and Spike, it failed utterly,
and only Billy heard it&mdash;with a start of surprise.
The next moment Blake&rsquo;s youthful
tenor warbled out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; on th&rsquo;
railroad, all th&rsquo; livelong day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, lounging somewhat apart from the
others, Joe betrayed amazing interest in
Blake&rsquo;s singing. He listened with his thick
lips parted and a surprising expression of animation
upon his usually stolid and immobile
features. Once when the others clapped their
hands vigorously in applause, he actually
clapped his also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, nudging Hugh with
his elbow. &ldquo;That Injun has an ear for music.
Just look at him! I never saw him perk
up this way before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Hugh, &ldquo;all his people love
music. They have their own wild, sad songs.
Perhaps Joe might sing. I&rsquo;ll ask him, in a moment.
Joe,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you sing for us?
We&rsquo;d like to hear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing? No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Joe refused, shaking his head almost
sullenly, and regarding Hugh with suspicion.
But when, after a little, he seemed
somewhat satisfied that he was not being made
sport of and that Hugh really wished him to
sing, he reluctantly consented.</p>
<p>That song was one which none who heard it
ever forgot. It was wild and weird and full
of unspeakable pathos. It was more of a chant
than a song, more wailing than tuneful, and
to Hugh it seemed that Joe was lamenting the
lost power and greatness of his people. This,
however, Hugh knew could not be possible, for
he had often talked with the halfbreed and had
found that Joe knew no more of Indian history
than a child might learn at school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The singing of the guide seemed to bring a
spell upon them, for thereafter, that night,
they talked little and laughed less. Yet this
was undoubtedly because they were tired and
sleepy and more than ready to seek their beds
of piled leaves.</p>
<p>All were astir early the following morning.
Immediately after breakfast they continued
the descent to the lake, and, following the
shore, encountered many obstacles, being compelled
more than once to enter the water in
order to avoid climbing over precipitous rocks.
And as they went along, each one made careful
notes of things seen and done; for it had
been decided that the scout who showed the
most knowledge of woodcraft and who wrote
the best&mdash;that is, the clearest, fullest, yet most
concise&mdash;report of the hike should be
appointed leader of the signal corps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>In the course of the morning, as they were
almost upon level ground again, not very far
from Oakvale meadows and the town itself,
Joe suddenly disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>This was strange conduct, indeed, and they
marveled at it no less than at his uncanny ability
to slip from sight like an animal of the
forest. They called and sought for him in
vain, and Hugh and Spike were growing decidedly
uneasy, when Joe was seen running
toward them through the underbrush, apparently
in great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See um, see um?&rdquo; he gasped, pointing
through the trees and across the narrow valley,
where, on the brow of a hill, Lieutenant
Denmead&rsquo;s party could be seen, with the aid
of Alec&rsquo;s field-glasses, making their way down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we see. They got here before
us, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good t&rsquo;ing! Good t&rsquo;ing we get out of de
woods. Woods a-fire! See!&rdquo; He pointed up
the hill they had just descended, and they saw
a column of dark smoke rising against the sky.
&ldquo;Wind blow fire dis way. Comin&rsquo; soon,
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je-ru-salem!&rdquo; exclaimed &ldquo;Spike&rdquo; Welling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; Billy added excitedly.
&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; cried Alec, grabbing his rival&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;See that old farmhouse over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it. What of&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right in the path of the fire that&rsquo;s
sweeping down this hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh sprang forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, it&rsquo;s up to us!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Thank
fortune, we&rsquo;ve got our signal flags and heliograph
with us! When the other half of our
party starts for the town on the run, we&rsquo;ve
got to signal to them, telling them just where
the fire is; then they can tell the firemen in
Oakvale what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Save that farmhouse!&rdquo; yelled Alec. &ldquo;Come
on, boys! Out here on this high rock with
me! Now, get out your flags!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crack of Joe&rsquo;s rifle burst upon the warm
morning air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll attract their attention to us!&rdquo; Hugh
called out. &ldquo;Ready now! Come on, begin the
messages. Work those flags as we&rsquo;ve never
worked them before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE END OF THE HIKE.</span></h2>
<p>While Alec and Blake remained at their post
of duty on the rock, exchanging messages with
Lieutenant Denmead&rsquo;s half of the corps&mdash;who,
as soon as they understood the need,
hurried across the meadow, entered the town,
and went directly to the only engine house of
which Oakvale could boast,&mdash;Hugh and Spike
hastened back some distance up the hill, to see
whence the fire was coming and how far it
had already spread. Joe, on his part, decided
to set out for the farmhouse to give warning,
if it should be necessary. He lingered only
to make sure that Alec&rsquo;s and Blake&rsquo;s sendings
were received and understood by the
others in the town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>In the excitement attending the discovery
of the fire, when he leaped down from the rock
to follow Spike up hill, Hugh lost his little
leather-covered tablet or note-book in which
he had jotted down memoranda of the march.
That is, it fell from his pocket and lay at the
base of the rock upon which Alec and Blake
stood waving and wig-wagging.</p>
<p>Alec saw it fall, and an expression of mean
satisfaction stole over his face. Clambering
down from the rock, for a moment, he ground
the little note-book into the soft earth with his
heel, then took up his position once more.</p>
<p>He did not see Joe watching this act, nor
did he count on the halfbreed&rsquo;s secret preference
for Hugh. He only realized that without
these notes Hugh would be unable to write
a good report of the hike, and would therefore
fail to win the leadership of the signal corps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>To their surprise, Hugh and Spike found
that the breeze, instead of blowing the fire
up hill, as it ordinarily would do, was sending
it down the slope from a point about half way
from the summit; also, that the fire was
spreading in an irregular semi-circle which
would sweep over the farm as it advanced.
They made strenuous efforts to stamp out the
end of the blazing curve by beating it with
branches torn from a young sapling, and succeeded
in getting a very small part of it under
control.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the ground was covered thickly
with leaves and leaf-mould, damp after recent
rains, and so the tongues of flame rose no
higher than the lowest branches of the trees,
which they licked greedily and then passed on,
seeking whatever they might devour.</p>
<p>Finding their best efforts of little avail,
Spike and Hugh hastened to rejoin their companions.</p>
<p>When they came to the rock, they found
the others had gone on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they&rsquo;ve gone to the farmhouse,&rdquo;
said Spike. &ldquo;Come on, Hugh! Which way?
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Hugh responded, glancing around
and pointing to a huge fir tree, upon the trunk
of which an arrow was freshly blazed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of Joe&rsquo;s signs. They&rsquo;ve gone in
the direction this arrow points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wond-wonder&mdash;what&mdash;sort o&rsquo; help the
lieutenant and&mdash;and his scouts found&mdash;found
in the vil-village?&rdquo; panted Spike, as they ran
on down hill, plunging through clumps of second-growth
pines, now slipping over the
smooth brown &ldquo;needles,&rdquo; now crashing
through masses of trailing vines and tall ferns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a one-horse engine and-and
a bucket brigade, most likely!&rdquo; Hugh replied,
coughing in the smoke that came drifting between
the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Presently they emerged from the wood and
came out upon the wide clearing in the center
of which stood the farmhouse, the big red
barn, and a group of smaller buildings. Before
them lay a swampy meadow, evidently a
hog-pasture, surrounded by a rail fence; on
their right extended an orchard whose trees
were heavy with green fruit; beyond that, a
cornfield glistened in the sunlight; and, still
further, acres of waving grain swayed lightly
as the breeze passed over them. Strange to
say, not an animal nor a human being save
themselves was to be seen, and an uncanny silence
reigned over the farm.</p>
<p>Hugh vaulted over the rail fence, followed
by Spike, and together they began to pick their
way as rapidly as possible across the pasture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky thing this is swampy,&rdquo; remarked
Hugh, &ldquo;because the fire won&rsquo;t be able to crawl
over this&mdash;ugh!&mdash;muck, and get near the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but don&rsquo;t forget it is creeping around
from that side,&rdquo; Spike answered gloomily.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where the danger lies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. But where on earth are the
rest of the crowd? Is this place deserted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks so, certainly. Hello! There&rsquo;s someone
coming from the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, an old woman appeared
in the doorway and came forth, shading her
eyes with one hand and blinking anxiously
around her. Catching sight of the two youths
as they ran toward her, she called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer th&rsquo; land&rsquo;s sake! More o&rsquo; yer! Boys,
is it true there&rsquo;s a fire broke out on ther mountain?
Two boys an&rsquo; a wild-lookin&rsquo; man come
along here, &rsquo;bout half an hour ago, yellin&rsquo; like
demons from ther pit, and they scart me an&rsquo;
my ol&rsquo; man out o&rsquo; our senses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told the truth, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Spike,
with breathless politeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; Hugh added reassuringly.
&ldquo;It may not be a very dangerous
fire, and we&rsquo;ve sent for help from Oakvale.
Are you alone here? I mean, is there anyone
who&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a soul but me and Jake,&rdquo; returned
the old woman. &ldquo;Jake Walsh is my husband;
he&rsquo;s laid up in bed with the rheumatiz,&rdquo; she
added, by way of explanation, &ldquo;an&rsquo; our son
Tom&rsquo;s gone to town with the calves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any cattle in the barn?&rdquo; inquired
Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ol&rsquo; bay-mare&mdash;but ye can&rsquo;t call her cattle,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;Ther cows is all in
that meadow, yonder. But ther barn&rsquo;s full o&rsquo;
hay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, both boys thought of the destruction
that wind-driven sparks might create, if
they should chance to light upon that dry old
barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;ll I do? What&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo; wailed
the poor woman, wringing her hands as she began
to realize the seriousness of the situation.
&ldquo;I never dreamed as there&rsquo;d be any danger o&rsquo;
fire in the woods this summer, though Tom
has often ernough spoke o&rsquo; folks&rsquo; carelessness
a-lightin&rsquo; fires an&rsquo; leavin&rsquo; &rsquo;em lay. I can&rsquo;t leave
Jake! I can&rsquo;t get away from here with him
not able ter walk! An&rsquo; Tom&rsquo;s took ther only
wagon we have! Oh, what&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you, Mrs. Walsh,&rdquo; declared
Hugh. &ldquo;Besides, the village fire-brigade will
be here soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spike, you&rsquo;d better climb up that windmill,
and see if you can communicate with the village,&rdquo;
he added, and Welling hastened to obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the engine-house,&rdquo; Spike called
down, a few minutes later. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little
tower on it, and someone is up in the tower,
waving a flag. It&rsquo;s Don Miller; I can tell by
the way he jerks the flag. He&rsquo;s sending: &lsquo;We
get your message now&mdash;fire brigade rushed to
farm&mdash;close by&mdash;do your best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>They did their best, too. Long before the
little engine-and-hose-cart had reached the outskirts
of the farm, they had carried old Jake
Walsh on an improvised litter out of the house
and some distance away to an abandoned cellar,
roofed over with boards and sods. Leaving
him there in charge of his wife, they had
returned to the farmyard, drawn buckets of
water from the well, poured them over the roof
and walls of the dwelling, and had begun &ldquo;policing&rdquo;
the farmyard, watching for sparks,
when they were surprised and relieved to hear
shouts at a distance.</p>
<p>The shouts seemed to come from the wood.
They were accompanied by the thud of many
galloping hoofs and a crashing through the
thick underbrush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Presently more than a dozen horsemen
dashed into view, brandishing long poles
wrapped with wet blankets. They were the
advance guard of the fire-fighters, who had
galloped to the scene along an old disused logging
road through the woods. Without stopping
to ask needless questions, these horsemen
turned and made off at full speed, spiralling up
the hill in single file, shouting and calling as
they rode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could follow them!&rdquo; said Hugh,
gazing after the vanishing forms until they
disappeared in the shadows of the forest and
their shouts became mere echoes. &ldquo;But I guess
we&rsquo;ll have our work cut out for us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was thinking,&rdquo; answered
Spike ruefully.</p>
<p>The two youths did not waste much time in
unavailing wishes. Every now and then they
ran to the outskirts of the farm and penetrated
a little way into the wood, to learn, if
they could, whether the fire was drawing
nearer. Not being thoroughly acquainted with
the topography of this particular tract of land,
they did not know what obstacles the fire
might meet in its path, such as green hollows,
cup-like bogs in the depressions of the hills,
streams, or even small ponds. All these were
possible, for the country for miles and miles
around Pioneer Camp was unusually varied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>As it chanced, there was a swiftly flowing
brook&mdash;which in places widened to the size of
a small stream&mdash;not far away, on the edge
of the pasture where a few cows were stolidly
grazing; and this stream was the hope of old
Jake Walsh, the one bulwark against the attack
of the dreadful enemy. On their tour
of the farm, Hugh and Spike discovered this
running stream, and they realized its value
as a means of defence.</p>
<p>The worst danger, as they knew, was from
flying sparks; so they kept a careful watch for
these. Two old straw-stacks in the barnyard
would go like tinder, if these were once ignited,
and Mr. Walsh advised the boys to draw
water from the horse-tank under the windmill,
climb the stacks, and &ldquo;souse &rsquo;em good an&rsquo;
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d help ye, if I only could!&rdquo; groaned Jake
Walsh, after giving this urgent advice. &ldquo;But,
consarn these old good-fer-nothin&rsquo; limbs o&rsquo;
mine! they ain&rsquo;t a bit o&rsquo; use no more. I might&rsquo;s
well have one foot in ther grave as have my
whole livin&rsquo; carkiss laid up like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now; never you mind, Jake,&rdquo;
soothed his wife. &ldquo;Me an&rsquo; ther boys is lively
lads, and we&rsquo;ll take good care o&rsquo; them stacks.&rdquo;
This was more easily said than done; nevertheless,
with Hugh perched aloft on top of
the stack, and with Spike and old Mrs. Walsh
forming a bucket-brigade and handing pails
of water up to him, the task was somehow accomplished.</p>
<p>In the midst of their labors they paused,
hearing the sound of wheels along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s your son returning?&rdquo; suggested
Spike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t him,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Walsh,
putting her hand to her ear. &ldquo;Tom took ther
heavy farm waggin, and it would make a
louder noise than that. Besides, Polly always
whinnies when she&rsquo;s nearin&rsquo; home, an&rsquo; ther ol&rsquo;
mare answers her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horse and buggy,&rdquo; Hugh announced
from his look-out. &ldquo;There comes another,
with three men in it. Hand me one more
bucket-full, Spike, old scout. Now! I guess
we&rsquo;ve soused the stack enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid down the slippery side of the straw-stack,
and the three workers awaited the coming
of the first arrivals from the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back to see how my ol&rsquo; man&rsquo;s
gettin&rsquo; on; he&rsquo;s like to be fussin&rsquo; an&rsquo; frettin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Walsh. &ldquo;If Tom&rsquo;s come back in
thet buggy, leavin&rsquo; the waggin ter be fetched
later, he&rsquo;ll know what ter do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she walked slowly away to the
warm, dry cellar where her husband directed
the proceedings like a general on a battlefield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>In a few minutes the buggy rattled into the
farmyard, and Tom Walsh and his two companions
sprang from it to pour a volley of
questions and thanks upon the two boys. It
was not long before the farmyard became the
scene of a motley gathering of Oakvale&rsquo;s livelier
inhabitants, men, women, and children,
who drove up in all sorts of vehicles, including
automobiles, and brought every conceivable
implement for fighting a forest fire. Most
of them did not linger there long, but set out
for the woods.</p>
<p>Billy Worth arrived on horseback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t possible to fetch the hosecart all
this way up here,&rdquo; explained Tom, &ldquo;but we got
everything else we could lay hands on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, in a large touring-car owned by
a resident of Oakvale, came Lieutenant Denmead,
Walter, Arthur, and Cooper, and they
brought with them Alec and Blake, whom
they had picked up on the way. By unanimous
wish, the scouts lost no time in hurrying to
the woods after the other fire-fighters, and all
did yeoman service in putting out the blaze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Late in the afternoon the fire was finally
extinguished. Fortunately the Walsh farm
escaped damage, except for a blaze in
a thatched cow-shed, and the farmer and his
wife and son were deeply grateful. Mrs.
Walsh insisted on serving supper to all who
had remained until the danger was over; and
when it was generally learned that the prompt
arrival of the motley fire brigade was due to
the warning given by the young signalers,&mdash;for,
strange to say, the smoke in the woods
had not been considered alarming by the village
folk, who were used to camping parties
among the hills,&mdash;Lieutenant Denmead&rsquo;s
corps were the guests of honor at that
&ldquo;spread.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>And such a feast it was! After all the work
and excitement, they were as hungry as
wolves, and the simple supper of ham and
eggs, crisp fried potatoes, pancakes and honey,
washed down with copious glasses of fresh
milk, was a banquet fit for the gods! Afterward,
they were invited to spend the night in
the hayloft of the barn, if they chose; but the
Scout Master thought it best to decline this
kindly, apologetic invitation and to resume the
trip back to camp. Accordingly they took leave
of the Walshes, and set forth, with well-filled
stomachs and light hearts, glad of another opportunity
to camp out in the open that night.</p>
<p>Before noon of the following day they
reached Pioneer Camp and were hailed as conquering
heroes by their friends.</p>
<p>On the return march, Hugh discovered the
loss of his note-book. However, he said nothing
to anyone, not even to Billy. The blow
was hard to bear, the accident crushing to his
hopes of leadership; but he knew he had only
himself to blame, and he resolved to accept the
mischance with a good grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED REPROOF.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hist, old man!&rdquo; Dick Bellamy whispered,
slipping out of his bunk. &ldquo;Something is up,
and I can&rsquo;t make out what it is. Don&rsquo;t say
anything,&mdash;just keep quiet and use your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec, strangely thrilled, listened intently.
The sounds Dick had heard, and which now
came to Alec distinctly, consisted of a muffled
scraping outside the side wall of the cabin, at
the window. Some one was working at the
catch.</p>
<p>It was long after &ldquo;taps&rdquo; and all the other
scouts of the Otter and the Fox patrols were
sound asleep in the cabin; that is, all save Alec,
who, being restless because of a troubled conscience,
had been startled by the vision of his
friend bending over him in the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think it is?&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep again, Dick; it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Alec
retorted scornfully. And the next instant he
marred the effect of his own words by asking:
&ldquo;What on earth do you suppose it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear, perhaps,&mdash;or the mate of Hugh&rsquo;s
bobcat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There are no bears around here,
Joe says, and you ought to know that a
bob&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak lower, Alec. It may be one of those
Canuk lumberjacks from the camp in the back-woods.
You remember, Pioneer Camp was
robbed last summer, and there was a row over
the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have a lively imagination,
Dick! Do you think a thing like that is going
to happen again so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not? You can&rsquo;t trust any one
of those toughs. I heard cook say so once,
and then he shut up like a clam &rsquo;cause he
thought Joe might hear him. Joe&rsquo;s respected
father was a Canuk, you know. Someone is
up to some treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word grated upon Alec&rsquo;s ears.
&ldquo;Treachery?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?
You accuse&mdash;Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were foolish to show off that roll of
bills your father sent you to buy camera supplies
with, this afternoon,&rdquo; was the whispered
response.</p>
<p>Alec gave a low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eating you, Dick, anyway? You&rsquo;re
twice as foolish to talk that way. Joe might
hear you. Besides, he&rsquo;s as honest as the daylight.
Do you think the Chief would employ
him if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! There&rsquo;s that noise again. I&rsquo;ll bet
someone is stealing into the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he steal in through the door,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid he&rsquo;ll make too much noise, I guess.
He&rsquo;d rather take his chance of coming through
a hole in the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making more noise than he would by
using the door,&rdquo; said Alec. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll nail him
when he gets inside. If it&rsquo;s some of the fellows
from the other cabin, Dick, we&rsquo;ll force
them to&mdash;&mdash;Get up, then, and get ready for
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently the two lads swung to a sitting posture
on the edge of their bunks, and, with
straining eyes, peered through the thick gloom
toward the wall from which the muffled sounds
were coming. Suddenly, as they watched and
waited, the lower sash of the window,&mdash;which,
by the way, was next to Alec&rsquo;s bunk,&mdash;was
raised slowly, and a man&rsquo;s head and shoulders
appeared against the lighter background of silvery
moonbeams. This human figure silhouetted
itself sharply in the opening, evidently
not striving for concealment, and an
arm was thrust through. It seemed to be groping
around in the darkness of the log-house,
and finally a hand rapped softly on Alec&rsquo;s
bunk, almost touching his leg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Alec crawled to the foot of his bed, slipped
down, and stepped to Dick&rsquo;s side. Dick also
rose, and the two moved noiselessly upon the
prowler.</p>
<p>The man grunted and breathed hard, while
crawling through the window. Just as he was
on the point of tugging at Alec&rsquo;s pillow, both
Alec and Dick seized him. Like a flash, he
turned, without making a sound; it seemed that
he was astounded, for a moment.</p>
<p>Yet his amazement was quite apart from the
surprise of the unexpected seizure. A gurgling
laugh sounded in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got me! You th&rsquo; boy I want to see,&rdquo;
he chuckled, turning to Alec.</p>
<p>The moonlight fell full upon his swarthy
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; gasped Alec. &ldquo;What are you doing
here at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see you,&rdquo; explained the half breed,
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? What for? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me
what you want after we got back yesterday?&rdquo;
Alec&rsquo;s nervousness betrayed itself in the tones
of his voice. &ldquo;You could have spoken to me
last evening at the council-fire. What&rsquo;s
the&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time then, no time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I forgot we&mdash;the signal corps&mdash;are
going to Oakvale to-morrow. The Chief
told us last night, Dick, that Major Brookfield
invited us to join his headquarters&rsquo; staff of
signalers in the maneuvers, and so we&rsquo;re going
to the National Guard camp for a few
days. Major Brookfield was in Oakvale yesterday,
and the Chief saw him there. The major
was pleased with the signal work we did
during the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Dick Bellamy heard only a few words of
Alec&rsquo;s news. He kept his eyes fixed upon the
face of the guide, wondering if by any unlucky
chance Joe had overheard any of the insinuations
which he, Dick, had uttered. At
heart Dick was afraid of &ldquo;Injun Joe,&rdquo; as he
called him&mdash;behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see you, Alec,&rdquo; repeated Joe, moving
toward the door, which, as Alec and Dick
had forgotten, was locked on the inside.
&ldquo;Come out with me&mdash;out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something authoritative in his voice and
manner made Alec obey without protest. Unbolting
the door as noiselessly as possible in
order not to waken the sleepers, and leaving
Dick to crawl back to his bunk, the Indian
and the white boy glided out into the open
space between the two cabins, and stood facing
each other in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe find somethin&rsquo; to-day,&rdquo; began the guide,
fumbling in the pocket of his coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something of mine? Something that belongs
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you give it to me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becos you&rsquo;re a scout, becos Joe a scout,
too!&rdquo; Joe&rsquo;s unusually stolid features relaxed
in a grim smile. &ldquo;You no un&rsquo;erstan&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clad only in his pajamas, Alec shivered; but
not entirely because of the chill night air on
his body. The presence of the man before him,
the vague reproach conveyed in Joe&rsquo;s softly
guttural tones, gave, him a curious &ldquo;creepy&rdquo;
sensation of cold and a weakness in the knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-what is it?&rdquo; he questioned, extending
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. You take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe handed the boy a small, thin, oblong
thing that felt damp and gritty to Alec&rsquo;s
touch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What shall I do with it? Oh,
Joe, is it that book of trout flies you promised
to sell me?&rdquo; asked Alec eagerly.</p>
<p>Joe grunted, and gave his broad shoulders
an expressive shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he mumbled; &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, with another shrug, he turned
and strode rapidly away in the direction of
his tent.</p>
<p>Alec looked down at the object in his hand.
In the moonbeams he could scarcely make out
what it was, for it was covered with mud-stains.
Mechanically he opened it and turned
what seemed to be pages soiled and crumpled
and badly torn. All at once he uttered a little
exclamation of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hugh Hardin&rsquo;s
note-book!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>When the signal corps reached the camp of
the National Guard, late in the following afternoon,&mdash;having
made the trip over to the Oakvale
meadows on foot as far as Rainbow Lake,
and thence in Tom Walsh&rsquo;s farm wagon,&mdash;they
were at once taken to Major Brookfield&rsquo;s
quarters and introduced to that officer. He received
them with a genuine cordiality that
straightway won their hearts, and he assigned
them to the Blue Army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is to be a sham battle next Saturday,&rdquo;
he told them, &ldquo;and the Blues feel that
they will be beaten because they are fighting
the regulars, who compose the majority of the
Reds, though they, the Blues, outnumber their
foes. I want you boys to do all you can to save
the day. Who is the leader of this corps,
Lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not yet elected a leader, Major
Brookfield,&rdquo; answered Scout Master Denmead,
&ldquo;owing to the fact that we hadn&rsquo;t time, before
coming here, to apply the last test which I had
decided upon. You see, we left camp rather
hurriedly this morning, in order to be here on
time for the beginning of the maneuvers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. Well, it won&rsquo;t make any difference,
anyway. Perhaps the work these lads
are going to do with us may be counted further
toward some one&rsquo;s election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an excellent idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first &lsquo;job&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll have,&rdquo; continued the
Major, addressing his attentive listeners, &ldquo;is
to go out ahead with a detachment of Blues
and help lay telegraph wires. I presume most
of you are pretty well grounded in elementary
surveying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts replied by saluting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, follow my aide here, and he&rsquo;ll
put you in charge of the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In orderly array, the eight scouts of the signal
corps left headquarters and were duly presented
to the captain in command of the detachment
of Blues. Their work began that
very evening, for they were ordered to proceed
from camp and take possession of a high
mound east of the village, a strategic point
which the Reds coveted, because it commanded
telegraphic communication with Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>By the time this mound had been scaled and
captured, after a skirmish with a few Red defenders,
the eight new recruits, albeit thrilled
by their first experience of mock warfare, were
thoroughly tired. Wrapped in their blankets,
they stretched themselves on the grassy slope
of the mound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe enough here, and we can be
comfortable,&rdquo; said Alec to Walter Osborne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good fun, this,&rdquo; was Walter&rsquo;s sleepy comment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep with one eye open.&rdquo;
He pulled the blanket over him, and yawned.
&ldquo;Forty winks for me, this night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-four thousand, you mean! I have a
life-size picture of you sleeping with one eye
open, after all we&rsquo;ve been through to-day!
Well, I&rsquo;m dog-weary. Good night, old scout,
and pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you, Alec.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows shut up and go to sleep!&rdquo; came
Cooper Fennimore&rsquo;s voice: out of the darkness.
&ldquo;Hi, there, Arthur! Quit punching me in the
ribs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never touched you,&rdquo; protested Arthur, in
a drowsy drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, why so silent?&rdquo; demanded Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh is studying astronomy, fellows,&rdquo;
Blake Merton declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I was just
thinking that &rsquo;way off in Pioneer Camp &lsquo;taps&rsquo;
is sounding now, and Billy the Wolf is wishing
he were here with us. Good old Billy!
Hope he wasn&rsquo;t <i>very</i> much disappointed about
not making the corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Hugh Hardin to
wish that his chum might share adventures
and good-fortune with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Suddenly, across Alec&rsquo;s drowsy consciousness
stole a slight jealousy of Billy Worth.
Never had he felt this before; never had he
wished that he and Hugh might be friends
with no indifference on Hugh&rsquo;s part toward
him, and no hostility on his own. Surely if
Billy Worth, whom Alec really liked, found
Hugh worthy of respect and regard, Hugh
must be a friend worth claiming. Yet what
had he done to make of Hugh a friend? Nothing.
On the contrary, he had been guilty of a
mean and selfish act which, if Hugh suspected
it, could not easily be forgiven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scout is friendly. He is a friend to all
and a brother to every other scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ran the fourth law which Alec had promised
to obey when he took the scout oath. And
how had he kept that law? By treachery to
another!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I must be tireder than I thought,&rdquo;
he told himself, trying to account for these
disturbing reflections. &ldquo;If I want to, I can
return Hugh&rsquo;s notes to him when we go back
to camp; they&rsquo;re hidden in my locker now. I
suppose Joe meant that it was up to me to return
them. Why didn&rsquo;t he do it himself? It
would be more like him, the sly dog! I wish
he had! I don&rsquo;t want to return them; they&rsquo;re
so much better than mine. Oh, well, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>But here his brain and body seemed to yield
all at once to the overpowering spell of tired
youth, and he sank into dreamless slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE SHAM BATTLE.</span></h2>
<p>Such half-formed resolutions, good or bad,
as those which had troubled Alec that night
were naturally lost sight of in the stirring
events of the next three days. Like the others
in the signal corps, he was absorbed in the
work assigned to them: surveying the countryside,
working with the linemen who were
sent on ahead to lay wires, sending and receiving
telegraphic and signal messages concerning
the movements of &ldquo;the enemy.&rdquo; It
was a wonderful experience for the eight
young scouts, and they entered into it with a
will and with credit to themselves for their
part in the general scheme.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Denmead was proud of them and
delighted at the success of his idea in forming
the corps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Friday came all too soon, in spite of the fact
that the eagerly awaited battle was to be
fought on the morrow. When the Blues
pitched camp that evening, they had advanced
several miles into the territory supposed to be
defended by the Red Army, and they found
themselves in a rather advantageous position.</p>
<p>The Blues had selected their position with
care. Two roads, one a highway, the other
the logging road which skirted the Walsh
farm, approached the town of Oakvale like
the two halves of a wishbone, the best position
being at the meeting point. Thus the
Blues were so placed that the men were able
to see down the valley and to cover the advance
of the Reds whichever way they came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>When the camp was quiet and no sounds
could be heard except the measured tread of
a sentry going his rounds, Hugh, being warm
and dusty after the day&rsquo;s skirmishing and
marching, longed to go for a dip in the nearby
stream. The longing grew upon him to such
a degree that he rose from his cot and stole
forth beyond the picket line, going straight
toward the place where the stream formed a
deep and narrow pool between some rocks.</p>
<p>The night was warm for that season, and
a crescent moon hung low in the heavens, only
a little way above the tops of the tallest trees.
Hugh found the light sufficient to guide him
through the wood, and, reaching the pool, he
shed his garments, and plunged in.</p>
<p>For a few minutes he swam lazily to and
fro; then, all of a sudden he was startled by
hearing a splash near him and a sound of
spluttering, as someone else took the plunge.
The next moment a head appeared above the
inky ripples of the pool and with a vigorous
shake came swimming toward him, the body to
which it belonged being propelled swiftly and
silently through the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sam?&rdquo; whispered Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognized your crawl stroke, Sam; there
isn&rsquo;t one to beat it in Pioneer Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed where you were going, old man,
and followed you here. Isn&rsquo;t this great! Gee!
I wish we could get up a set of swimming
matches at night when we go back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a crazy idea! The Chief wouldn&rsquo;t
consider it for a moment; it&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Spose it is,&rdquo; admitted Sam. &ldquo;I was only
thinking what fun this is, and not of&mdash;&mdash;Say,
Hugh, did you hear footsteps just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did, but wasn&rsquo;t sure. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Floating easily on their backs, the two lads
lay motionless in the water under the overhanging
rock, and strained their ears to catch
a suspicious sound. To their intense surprise,
a man&rsquo;s voice broke the silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Groome&rsquo;s division is just beyond
here,&rdquo; it said softly. &ldquo;He intends to meet
your colonel half a mile beyond the intersection
of two trails in the wood, at the rear of
the Blue camp, and advance upon them from
that point, early to-morrow morning. The
Blues have no idea that we&rsquo;re so close to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking for us down the valley,&rdquo;
responded a deeper voice. &ldquo;Thanks for the information,
sir. I&rsquo;ll go back now and report
it at once to the colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will we, Sam!&rdquo; added Hugh, in an
excited whisper, when the unknown speakers
had returned whence they had come. &ldquo;Do you
know what this means? Why, we&rsquo;ve overheard
two Red officers confiding plans for an
attack on us to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure this war game hasn&rsquo;t turned your
head, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it hasn&rsquo;t! Didn&rsquo;t you hear them
with your own ears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t make much sense out
of what they were saying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;No matter; it&rsquo;s important, all the same.
The thing that puzzled me was: Why did they
choose this spot so near our lines for their
meeting just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they couldn&rsquo;t arrange for a safer
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Sam, let&rsquo;s go back. We&rsquo;ve got
to tell what we&rsquo;ve just learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few strokes carried them to the edge of
the pool; they scrambled out, dressed hastily,
and hurried to the tent where Lieutenant Denmead
was sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to wake you up, sir,&rdquo; said Hugh,
when they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got most important news!&rdquo; supplemented
Sam, forgetting his previous scoffing
at the war game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, boys,&rdquo; said Denmead, sitting
up attentively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>They told him, not hesitating to confess
their breach of discipline in stealing out of
camp for a swim. When they had finished,
the Scout Master smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The importance of the news excuses the offense&mdash;this
once,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;Go back
to your cots and get a few hours of good sound
sleep in preparation for the work cut out for
you to-morrow. But report this plan to Major
Brookfield, the first thing you do. I&rsquo;ll go
with you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the gray light of Saturday morning the
&ldquo;battle&rdquo; began, with a rush of two troops of
Red infantry upon the camp of the Blues.</p>
<p>The ground surrounding the camp was very
uneven, and the advance of the Reds was impeded
by thick bushes, trailing vines, and slippery
stones embedded in the soil. Through
these vines and thorny bushes the Reds fought
their way, falling, stumbling, wet with perspiration,
panting for breath, but obeying their
colonel&rsquo;s commands instantly,&mdash;only to be met
by an alert and determined resistance on the
part of the Blue Army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The Blues disproved all that had been said
in criticism of them when the maneuvers
were first organized. They observed perfect
discipline and acted with coolness and intelligence.
Indeed, thanks to the information
Hugh and Sam had been enabled to bring, they
gave the attacking forces the greatest surprise
of the whole &ldquo;campaign,&rdquo; by receiving them
fully prepared and with a decimating fire of
blank cartridges, under which, according to
military tactics, the Reds might reasonably
have retreated.</p>
<p>But they did not retreat. Instead, there was
a steady, bold, cool advance, as the Reds
poured out of the woods like a swarm of angry
bees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Although surprised by the number of the
Reds, the Blues drove back one attack and successfully
foiled another by sending a company
to block the march of Red reinforcements up
the valley. Not for one minute during the
next two hours did the strain slacken, nor did
the officers on either side call a halt. The action,
both in the vicinity of the camp and
further down in the valley, was fast and incessant,
as at a good football game. The conduct
of all the men in the &ldquo;fight&rdquo; was worthy
of the highest praise.</p>
<p>It was when &ldquo;the tide of battle&rdquo; was at the
full that Hugh and Alec, who had been sent
to a lookout high up on the side of the hill,
observed that no more Reds were coming from
the valley along either road of the wishbone,
and that the company of Blues who had gone
out to check their advance were returning, triumphant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>By means of their semaphore flags, they signaled
this news down to the other scouts, as
well as to the regular signal men of the Blue
Army, with the result that a new movement
was decided upon:</p>
<p>The Blues made an unexpected sortie from
their position, and prepared to charge the
Reds.</p>
<p>In front of the border of woods were a hundred
yards or so of open ground covered with
high grass. At the edge of this grass, the
Colonel commanding the Reds ordered the
line to cease firing, drop, and wait for some
movement on the part of the enemy.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait. Major Brookfield
ordered his lines to charge across, and
the Blue men did so under a heavy but ineffectual
fire from the Reds. It looked like a
skirmish line thrown out in advance of a regiment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The Reds could not believe that so few men
would advance with such confidence unless
they momentarily expected large reinforcements,
so, without attempting to stop them,
they turned and ran. As their fire slackened,
those who were returning from the valley saw
them retreating, and the men in blue cheered&mdash;a
long, derisive, parting cheer.</p>
<p>This charge ended the fight and won the
day for the Blues.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Where are Hugh Hardin and Alec
Sands?&rdquo; inquired Denmead, a few hours later,
when the divided armies had returned to their
common camp on Oakvale meadows. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t
anyone seen them in camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Walter, giving the scout
salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know we&rsquo;re going back to our own
camp to-day, by automobile as far as the railroad
station nearest camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, they know it; but they haven&rsquo;t
showed up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can anything have happened to them, do
you think, Chief?&rdquo; queried Sam Winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should hardly suppose so. They may be
lost in the woods; but, in that case, each one
is capable of finding his way to Rainbow Lake,
and thence to Pioneer Camp. However, if we
don&rsquo;t see them or receive any message from
them before we start, I&rsquo;ll send out a search-party,
and we&rsquo;ll make the trip home on foot,
to see if we can find them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">AROUND THE COUNCIL-FIRE.</span></h2>
<p>A misfortune had indeed overtaken Alec and
Hugh soon after they had turned the tide in
favor of the Blue Army.</p>
<p>In descending from a ledge of rock that
overhung the valley to a lower level where a
path wound along the side of the hill, Alec,
carrying his flags in one hand, and clinging to
saplings that grew in the crevices of the rock
with the other, slipped and fell, barely saving
himself from tumbling headlong over the cliff.</p>
<p>When he attempted to rise, an excruciating
stab of pain in his left ankle gave warning
of a bad sprain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve twisted my ankle, Hugh,&rdquo; he said ruefully,
gazing up where Hugh knelt on the ledge
above him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear my weight on it just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke lightly, but there was a catch in his
voice.</p>
<p>Admiring his pluck, Hugh looked at him
with an expression of deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a second, Alec. I&rsquo;ll help you up out
of that little ravine you&rsquo;ve fallen into. Jingo!
I thought you would surely slide over the edge
when I saw you fall! I was so thankful that
you had the sense to stop short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I was!&rdquo; While he was speaking,
Hugh was lowering himself cautiously down
from the ledge, and creeping along until he
stood beside Alec. &ldquo;At last! Are you badly
hurt? Let&rsquo;s see your ankle. Why, it&rsquo;s beginning
to swell already! Here, let me take off
your heavy shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll never be able to get it on
again! As things are now, I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m
going to get down to Oakvale. And as for getting
back to Pioneer Camp!&mdash;it seems to be at
the other end of nowhere, so far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despair. As a matter of fact, I believe
our camp is nearer this spot than Oakvale
is. What do you say, Alec, to trying to
make our way back to Rainbow Lake? I remember
Joe left an old canoe there, and we can
paddle across and then find the trail back to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; responded Alec. &ldquo;Sorry I
can&rsquo;t go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can. And you&rsquo;re coming with
me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I <i>can&rsquo;t walk</i>! This darned ankle
hurts like sin! It may be broken, for all I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell in a moment,&rdquo; said Hugh, reassuringly,
and with no touch of boasting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>While he carefully felt the injured member,
Alec was suddenly reminded of a remark of
his own, a sneer at Hugh&rsquo;s qualifications in
first-aid. &ldquo;At my expense,&rdquo; Alec had said, and
now here was Hugh turning his knowledge to
Alec&rsquo;s benefit, very modestly and simply, quite
as a matter of course!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bones broken,&rdquo; announced Hugh, &ldquo;but
you must let me bind it up with a handkerchief
soaked in cold water, and then put on one of
my sneakers. Then we&rsquo;ll start for camp, before
it gets any worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec plucked up a little more courage at
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only get up out of this ravine,&rdquo;
he said, glancing around him in search of foothold,
&ldquo;I might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to carry you,&rdquo; said Hugh
quietly. But first he followed his own directions
for binding Alec&rsquo;s ankle firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when that was done
to his satisfaction and to Alec&rsquo;s relief, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to get you out of here. Just drape yourself
across my right shoulder, will you, and
let your legs hang down in front so that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hugh, you&rsquo;ll never be able to haul me
up out of this! I weigh as much as you do,
though I&rsquo;m not quite so tall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Please do just as I tell you,
and let&rsquo;s not waste any more time about it.&rdquo;
To his own surprise, Alec obeyed. Hugh knelt
on the ground while Alec slid forward over
his shoulder, throwing his right arm back over
Hugh&rsquo;s left shoulder. Then Hugh passed his
right arm between Alec&rsquo;s legs, seizing Alec&rsquo;s
right hand; then, shifting his burden a little,
he rose slowly. In this manner he staggered
up the sloping sides of the ravine, and reached
level ground and the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tough on you!&rdquo; he ejaculated,
breathing hard, as he placed Alec gently on
the ground. &ldquo;How much farther do you think
you can stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Hugh,&rdquo; cried Alec, &ldquo;what are
you thinking of? You can&rsquo;t carry me any
farther. I won&rsquo;t have it! I&rsquo;ll be ever so much
obliged to you if you&rsquo;ll break off that branch
of ash over there,&mdash;the one with a long knob
at one end of it,&mdash;so that I can use it for a
crutch,&mdash;and then please make tracks toward
Pioneer Camp as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you here alone? Not much!
What do you think I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger, Hugh. Besides, the
sooner you get to camp and send Joe and a
search-party out after me, the sooner I&rsquo;ll get
there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh shook his head decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I won&rsquo;t do that. But, speaking
of search-parties, why can&rsquo;t we signal to the
National Guard camp and ask them to send
one? Where are the flags?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dropped out of my hand and fell over
the cliff,&rdquo; replied Alec.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad! Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo; Hugh
broke off the branch Alec had pointed out,
whittled it smooth, and gave it to his companion.
&ldquo;There you are! Now, do you think
we can stagger on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I&rsquo;ll try, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, they did stagger on, Hugh assisting
Alec over the rough places, or going before
him to sweep aside the entangling vines
and brakes and low-hanging boughs that obstructed
their path. The sun and their little
pocket compasses were their guides through
the mazes of the forest, and the fact that they
were never hopelessly lost was proof that they
were good woodsmen.</p>
<p>Time and time again, during that long, tedious,
wearisome, painful journey, Alec urged
Hugh not to wait for him but to go ahead and
return for him with friends from camp.
Finally, seeing that Alec was in great distress,
Hugh resolved to comply with this wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will leave you just as soon as we come to
Rainbow Lake, if you insist,&rdquo; he promised reluctantly.
&ldquo;But if you are attacked by any
wild animal, or if you should trip and have
another bad fall, I&rsquo;m not responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it happened, they had followed an old Indian
trail through the woods, one which led
them to the northern end of Rainbow Lake in
less time than they had counted on. This trail
must have saved them at least four miles and
twice as many hours.</p>
<p>But twilight had begun to fold in the hills
and to creep across the surface of the lake like
a veil, when they at last stood upon its shore.
It was too late to go to Pioneer Camp that
night, even had the canoe been on hand for
Hugh to use, instead of lying beached on the
bare pebbly shingle at the other end of the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to camp out again to-night,
here,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Have you any matches to
light a fire with, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I always carry my fire-stick, drill,
and bow with me. You get some good tinder,
Hugh, and I&rsquo;ll make a fire in two shakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Hugh returned with a
handful of pounded cedar wood, dry and
sweet-smelling, and while he went to try and
gather a few berries for their supper, Alec
prepared to start the fire. First he gave a few
strokes with the drill, then rearranged the tiny
sticks he had placed over the tinder, and tried
a few more strokes. No success. He gave
half a dozen deft twirls to the drill&mdash;the smoke
burst forth. He covered it with the tinder,
fanned it a few seconds, and then a bright
flame arose, just as Hugh returned with his
cap full of luscious blackberries.</p>
<p>The berries were all they had to eat that
night, but both youths were so tired they did
not complain. Long before actual night had
fallen, they were sound asleep, wrapped in
their blankets, side by side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>And still Alec had said nothing, as yet, about
the rebuke which Joe, the half breed, had given
him. Time enough for that, when they were
safe at Pioneer Camp once more.</p>
<p>The next morning Hugh went in quest of
the canoe, which he secured after considerable
delay. Then he paddled back to the place
where Alec awaited him, and soon the pair
were gliding swiftly over Rainbow Lake and
down the brawling stream which connected it
with Pioneer Lake.</p>
<p>When at last they burst upon the waters of
the larger lake and sent a yell of joy echoing
across it, their cry was answered by another
yell from camp, and soon the shore and the
pier and the raft were crowded with eager
friends waiting to welcome them.</p>
<p>Around the council-fire that evening sat the
entire troop, for the leader of the signal corps
was to be elected, after the reports of the hike
had been read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Alec, pale as a ghost, had sought Hugh
after mess, and told him all he had tried to
do to thwart his rival and to deprive him of
the chance for leadership. It was bitterly hard
to make that confession, but, in spite of his
faults, Alec Sands &ldquo;came up to the scratch&rdquo;
in the final test, and acquitted himself by telling
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartily ashamed of my actions and my
thoughts concerning you, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, in
a low, shaky voice. &ldquo;In the future, after your
kindness to me yesterday, I&rsquo;ll be all the more
ashamed, and sorry, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want you to remember
anything unpleasant between us!&rdquo; laughed
Hugh. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget it, Alec, and be friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands upon that compact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I hope&mdash;I feel sure&mdash;that I&rsquo;m shaking
hands with the leader of the signal corps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>And Alec&rsquo;s remark was indeed true, for
Lieutenant Denmead announced that evening
that Hugh Hardin was appointed leader of the
corps.</p>
<p>Thereafter, with Alec&rsquo;s former hostility removed,
there was not a scout in Pioneer Camp
who did not congratulate Hugh with genuine
pleasure,&mdash;for, when the history of the
maneuvers was told, all felt that Hugh&rsquo;s reward
had been fairly won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">A MOUNTAIN ADVENTURE.</span></h2>
<p>Early one morning in the following week,
Hugh and Alec, moved by a spirit of newly cemented
friendship, asked that they, attended
by Indian Joe and accompanied by Billy Worth
and Sam Winter, be permitted to make a trip
on foot through the wilderness, to a mountain
about five miles east of old Stormberg.</p>
<p>This request Lieutenant Denmead readily
granted, after giving each of the four young
&ldquo;mountaineers,&rdquo; as he called them, a physical
examination, testing heart, lungs, muscle, etc.
&ldquo;It ought to be a rule in all camps,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that no boy whose heart is not first examined
should attempt a mountain climb over a thousand
feet, or a long march,&mdash;that is, no boy
in his teens. You fellows, with the exception
of Alec, are &lsquo;sound in wind and limb.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me, sir?&rdquo; queried
Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that ankle of yours, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Chief! It&rsquo;s quite
strong again. I had forgotten all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. But be careful. By the
way, I think I&rsquo;ll ask Rawson to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wish he would come!&rdquo;
the boys responded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Accordingly, George Rawson joined the expedition
that set forth bright and early next
morning. Each member carried a haversack
filled with provisions, in addition to the regular
equipment for camping-out in fine weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The peak which they intended to climb was
locally known as the Pinnacle. Higher than
old Stormberg, it rose in the heart of the forest,
and was approached from camp, first by a
long-disused logging road that skirted the
lower end of Pioneer Lake, then by trails and
bridle-paths, and finally by a single trail that
wound up its rocky sides. Though not remote
from camp, it was nearly nightfall when the
little party arrived at a farmer&rsquo;s barn nestling
at the foot of the mountain, and, as a reward
for helping him with the last of the day&rsquo;s
&ldquo;chores,&rdquo; were allowed to sleep in his hayloft.
Much as they preferred to sleep in the open, a
heavy rain&mdash;which had begun suddenly during
the last two hours of their march&mdash;forced them
to seek the shelter of the barn.</p>
<p>The morrow dawned in a heavy fog, and the
Scouts were astir early in anticipation of clear
weather. After a breakfast of oatmeal cakes,
hard-boiled eggs, and cereal coffee, Hugh and
Billy approached Joe, who was packing the
cooking outfit, and said, &ldquo;Rawson says we can
go ahead a little if you will show us the trail,
Joe. He has climbed the Pinnacle before, and
will follow later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Joe gave a grunt of assent, and the three
strapped on their haversacks once more, left
the barnyard, and struck out into the woods.</p>
<p>As they began to ascend the mountain the
wreaths of fog floated higher and higher above
them, until the sun came forth in full splendor
and all the moist, dripping woods were bathed
again in light. In a few minutes Hugh realized,
with a thrill of excitement, that the slopes
of the magic peak were actually under his feet!
He stumbled frequently over the broken rocks,
helping himself up with the aid of trees, saplings,
and undergrowth. Billy, less lithe and
agile than Hugh, found it more difficult to keep
in Joe&rsquo;s wake; and further, he was encumbered
with a camera, which he had insisted on taking
with him on this trip. How he managed to
carry the thing along without smashing it, he
could never afterward explain; but in the
course of that day he got some remarkable
photographs, and thereby added several points
to the credit score of the Wolf Patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Occasionally they were obliged to swing by
their arms, like apes, from roots or branches
projecting over the edge of some miniature
precipice. Their faces were scratched by
brambles, their hands cut by the sharp edges
of rocks, and their clothing torn by the jagged
limbs of broken pines and hemlocks.</p>
<p>It was after ten o&rsquo;clock before they reached
a broad ledge, where they paused to rest and
wait for the others. And it was twilight again
before the reunited party reached the summit.</p>
<p>Stunted evergreen trees covered the top of
the mountain, but the weary Scouts found a
comparatively open space in an angle of rocks
on one side, a few yards down, and there they
made a bed of pine twigs. Then, collecting a
heap of dead branches, they soon had a roaring
fire. On all sides lay the wilderness, a great
dark gulf beneath them. From among the
trees came the nocturnal cries of wild animals,
the hoot of a great horned owl, and the soughing
of the fitful wind in the pines. In an hour
the moon rose and shed a faint illumination
over the weird scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>In the morning the wilderness was like a
green ocean surrounding that island peak, even
the sharp, spiky tops of trees blending softly
in a light haze. After disposing of breakfast,
the party started to descend the mountain on
another side, attracted by a lake that they had
noticed shining in the light of the moon. But
unwittingly they chose the worst possible place
for descent, and that, in spite of Joe&rsquo;s general
knowledge of the locality. In about an hour
they found themselves involved in perpendicular
cliffs and headlong pitches of the mountainside,
which seemed to their inexperience truly
frightful. At last they came out upon the
dizzy brow of a precipice which was too smooth
to afford any foothold.</p>
<p>The cliffs towering behind them seemed to
forbid return, and they searched anxiously for
a place where they dared attempt to descend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, at last, pointing to
a dead pine which had fallen against the face
of the precipice and remained leaning there.
&ldquo;We got to climb down that tree. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crawled forward until half of his body
was over the smooth ledge, then reaching down,
he grasped the topmost branch of the leaning
pine and swung himself over, landing on the
trunk of the tree. After that it was easy to
crawl along the trunk to its roots, which rested
upon more level ground. The feat was not
without peril, but it was the only way out of the
difficulty. Each member of the party in turn
followed Joe&rsquo;s example, crawling, clinging,
scrambling to safety. Then they looked back
at the sheer cliff and rejoiced that they had had
even this chance of escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Another danger, however, soon became evident.
They had lost their way! Wandering
in the intricacies of a &ldquo;windfall,&rdquo; they struggled
desperately with a tangled mass of
broken branches and uptorn roots. After
spending the greater part of the forenoon in
advancing perhaps half a mile, Sam climbed a
tree, gave a searching look around, and announced
that he had his bearings.</p>
<p>The half-breed climbed up, also, and surveyed
the landscape with his keen black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he grunted positively. &ldquo;Sam
guess right. Joe know Pioneer Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when by slow stages they approached
the lake, they found they still had to
traverse broad swamps. At last, they came
upon the backwoods trail which had grown familiar
in many stalking games and signaling
tests, and all their difficulties blended into the
single one of tramping for an hour or two
without food on a path that was wearisomely
long, though it led out of the wilderness. Presently
they emerged into the open, breaking into
a cheer at the welcome sight of the council-fire
of Pioneer Camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The &ldquo;mountaineers&rdquo; were quickly surrounded
by a mob of curious boys and bombarded
with eager questions. Rawson, however, demanded
water and food for the hungry travelers
first of all, and not until their exhausted
comrades were amply refreshed did the other
Scouts beg again to hear their experiences.
Then Hugh and Alec, supplemented by
Billy and Sam and endorsed by Rawson, told
the story of their mountain climb. When it
was finished, the council-fire had crumbled into
ashes, and the last sparks had died out in the
light of the stars.</p>
<p>Another day of camp-life was ended. As
the boys fell asleep, they smiled with content
at their lot, and wondered what new happenings
awaited them in the Land of Tomorrow,
at dawn to become another Today!</p>
<p>That there <i>were</i> new and strangely unforeseen
experiences before them, proof now exists,
for the record may be found in &ldquo;<span class="sc">The
Boy Scouts of Pioneer Camp</span>.&rdquo;</p>
